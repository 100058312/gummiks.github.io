_"What are you doing for Thanksgiving break, and more importantly: where are you eating turkey?"_ a friend asked me. 
_"Who, me? I'm heading North, to Canada - I might not eat any Thanksgiving-turkey this year. Don't worry though, I'll just eat twice as much next year!"_

We don't celebrate Thanksgiving in Iceland, so I didn't really mind missing out on the turkey (also: my family eats it during New Years Eve).
And yes, my Thanksgiving dinner ended up being a quick wrap-sandwich on the cold road, somewhere in the province of Quebéc.

We headed out, a crew of 4; three French, and one Icelander, travelling over 1800km in 5 days, covering 2 states, 2 provinces, in 2 countries.
We had a rough destination outline: A) Niagara Falls, from there swing up to B) Toronto to check out the CN-Tower; and then spend the remainder of the holidays in C) Montreal.
It was an ambitious goal. 
It took some resiliance (mostly on the driver's part), some enthusiasm, and some power-music, but we did it.

As anticipated, the journey itself was a large part of the trip. 
However, for me - the co-pilot and one of two master DJs - the time passed relatively quickly; for the driver I'm not as sure.
We did come prepared with a carefully crafted music playlist, consisting largely of songs made by indie and electronic groups that originate from an island a part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
Judging by the fact that we all had certain songs playing in our mind for the rest of the trip, I might have played some of them once or twice too often.
Moreover, countless stories were told (some in French with English <i>subtitles</i>) about things that first came to our minds. Those stories will not be listed here - _they would fill volumes_.

As we were heading straight to the capital of Québec, the French-speaking state of Canada, I felt I had to shape up my (totally non-existent) French skills.
And sure I did: I learned some very crucial first words, providing me with a diverse and lucid vocabulary, forming a sturdy basis to further build on. 
In return, I provided an equally descriptive vocabulary in my own mother tongue; words that ended up forming an effective and encrypted code language used in the midst of the French speaking Canadians - nobody speaks Icelandic, right? 

I immediately felt that there was something about Canada that I resonated with.
Maybe it was the chilly weather, temperatures routinely dropping to -8C or -10C, and sometimes to -15C. 
It was very interesting to see the Mediterranians' expressions seeing the temperature drop by one degree for every hour we drove North. The Icelander grinned.
Or maybe, maybe I was just glad to be finally travelling again.

Having only a rough outline of what to do, this trip - like all good trips are - was largely characterized by on-the-fly decisions and last minute finalizations.
Despite a few minor delays, everything went quite smoothly.
Living in a digital age where your smartphone has a better idea where you are going than yourself, and where you can find, read reviews, book, and pay for a hostel in less than 5 minutes,
it is getting exceedingly easy to travel. 
So what are you waiting for dear reader, give yourself the time (and some money - but money is best _invested_ in travelling right?), open your door and step out!
