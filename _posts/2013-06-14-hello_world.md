Hi!

My name is Guðmundur Kári [read it however you like - Icelandic pronounciation can be quite hard, believe me!], and yes, I'm from Iceland, "the land of the ice and snow, with the midnight sun and where the hot springs blow...". 
I'm leaving this place pretty soon though, and that for quite a while it seems.

This seems to be my first post here, and I might as well tell you who the intended audience is; well, __everybody__ - __everybody interested enough__. 

My skills in predicting the future have never been that good, so I can not be sure what I will be posting here, but I can say that it will probably be largely governed by what I think of at the spur of the moment.
Probably then, this blog will end up being full of sound and fury, written by an idiot, signifying nothing... - well, lets see!
