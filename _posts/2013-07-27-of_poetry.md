_"Hey, let's surprise our friend on his birthday in a graveyard!"_. 
At first, I was a bit sceptical about this idea, but upon execution it was quite surprising to our friend and the whole thing went _surprisingly_ well.

However, this was not some random graveyard, which, if it was, could have acted as an ironic remainder of his (and our) eventual demise, but a very specific graveyard: the Cimetière des Rois or _Cemetery of Kings_), where J. L. Borges is buried - our friend's favorite poet.
We sat there by his tomb, a group of 11, and recited some of our favorite poems and short stories by him.
Having only read one piece by him beforehand, a short story called _Borges and I_, or _Borges y yo_ in the original language, I didn't have much choice in choosing my contribution.
This piece, _Borges and I_, is a (really) short story he wrote about what he thinks of his image when he was an old and famous writer.
I recommend reading it, both the original Spanish version and an English translation can be found <a href="http://anagrammatically.com/2008/01/31/borges-and-i-borges-y-yo/">here</a>.
Supposedly though Borges himself was against translations, as things tend to get _lost in translation_.
We discussed about this _right up to the limits of logic_ , as we came from varying cultures from four different continents, having only English as our common language.
We finally agreed that whenever we had the occasion we read both versions of a given piece (as most of Borges' pieces were in Spanish); the original one _for appreciation_, and its translation _for understanding._

One thing I immediately found curious, is that that on the rear side of his tombstone is written _"Hann tekr sverthit Gram ok leggr i methal theira bert"_ - Old Nordic!
I was amazed!
Most of the words were very similar to their modern Icelandic counterparts, so I deciphered/translated it for my friends; _He takes the sword Gram and lays the naked blade between them_ (a reference to Völsungasaga - The Saga of the Völsungs!)
My friend explained that Borges used a lot of references in his works, 
often to the old Nordic sagas, which he highly appreciated.
He liked the "get-straight-to-the-point" approach of old Nordic storytelling, greatly contrasting the long-phrased poems and prose common in the Spanish language.



Never have I felt more like being in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097165/">Dead Poets Society</a>.

Well, until next time;
