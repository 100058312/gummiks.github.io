###Abstract
A group of CERN Summer students went on a hike to Creux du Van, Switzerland.
Below you can see some empirical observations from the trip, backed up with photographic-evidence.

###Weather
Highly dependent on height, and time of day.

  </li>
</ul>

###Wild-life
Some visible. Mostly ibexes and birds (excluding some wild summer students).

      <h3>{{ page.image3title}}</h3>
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

###Conclusion
In all the trip was a success, despite a small car incident (which proved to be trivial).
I wish to thank the various people from all over the globe for the fruitful discussions we had, and also _Nature_ for being so majestic.
