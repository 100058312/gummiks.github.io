_"What is a Tailgate?"_ - I naively asked my friend.
_"Its something typically American - you should come!"_, she answered.
I did. 

The jist: <code>Its basically an excuse to have fun.</code>

It usually involves grillin, and beer.
Moreover, you aren't obliged to go to the football game that follows - well, I didn't have a ticket.
I still have no idea how that sports works - I guess I have to make up it at some point during my years here.

_But wow._ There were a lot of people around. 
The town practically exploded.
_"During game weekends State College becomes the third biggest town in PA"_ - duly noted!
Supposedly Penn State takes tailgating to another level - <code>Beaver Stadium</code> could house the population of my whole capital easily!

I had fun. Others had too. 

Two random things; met a fellow that had visited Iceland - he said he would easily do it again, anytime. 
I know I would too. Second, some people seem to possess a natural talent in drinking games.
