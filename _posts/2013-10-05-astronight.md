I decided to volunteer for AstroNight, an annual outreach event held by the astronomy department, supposedly a smaller variant of its bigger brother <a href="http://www.astro.psu.edu/public-outreach/astrofest">AstroFest</a> which I haven't attended yet. 
I took my new <code>1.4 aperture</code> with me - I wanted to test it out. 

Regretfully the weather wasn't good.
Some of us feared that the people that really wanted to do the observing wouldn't come at all.
Nevertheless, a lot of people showed up, and all volunteers had a lot to do.

Initially not knowing my place, I ended up being a greeter. 
I have never seen so many people in Davey. 
It seemed like <i>the place to be at</i>!
The two main elevators just brought waves, and waves of new people.
Sometimes I greeted people twice. It didn't matter I think - they just asked more questions instead!

There were many stations; non-newtonian fluids, lots of <code>3D shows</code>, <code>various talks</code>, <code>planetarium shows</code>, <code>observations</code> (mostly showing them the telescopes - but supposedly the weather got a <i>little bit</i> better with time), <code>comet making</code>, <code>simple spectrographs</code>, <code>quizzes</code> <i>with prizes</i>, and whatnot related to astronomy & astrophysics.

In all it was very similar to the outreach activites I've done back in Iceland, as a part of the math & physics community there.
Thus, empirically I conclude; people from two different continents seem to behave in a very similar manner at science outreach activities.
