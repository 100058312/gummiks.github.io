<code>About Me</code>

<br/>

Hæ! (Icelandic for hi!)

<br/>
<br/>

<p>
I am a Fulbright student from Iceland, currently in my first year of my PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics at Penn State University. My primary research interest center around the study of <code>exoplanets</code>, their detection and characterization.
</p>

<p>
	When I'm not doing astrophysics (which nowadays seems mostly to consist of running/writing code, or grading papers) I like trying my luck with taking photos, especially when travelling. 
	Somewhere along the way I learned to play the guitar, and picked up a dan in Shotokan. My next immediate tasks hobby-wise are; finding a decent dojo and a good place to jam.
