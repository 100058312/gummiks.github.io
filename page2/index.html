<h2>Q: What is TLB?</h2>

<p><em>The translation-look-aside-buffer</em> (TLB) is a cache that memory management hardware uses to improve virtual address translation speed. Issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>But then what happens if this buffer isn't big enough?</p></li>
<li><p>The way the TLB works is likely different between different processors.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2><em>Virtual Memory Space/Virtual Address Space</em></h2>

<p>In the old days when you had only say 2MB of RAM, then you could use a feature called <em>'Virtual memory space'</em> to simulate that you might actually have 4MB of data.
This was came in handy when you were running <em>Windows</em>, and running both <em>Word</em>, and <em>Excel</em> at the same time, and both were hogging your memory.
So when you alt-tabbed you could actually save the memory on the window that was not being used to disk.</p>

<h2>Using higher level interfaces vs knowing the minute details</h2>

<p><strong>Higher level interfaces:</strong> <em>You don't really know what you are doing, but the good thing is, you are much quicker at it!</em></p>

<h2>Q: Why are <em>micro commands</em> reordered by the compiler/assembler?</h2>

<p>Lets say we are doing the computation: <code>A*B + C</code>.
Once you have translated the high-level language to micro-commands like <em>move this byte over here, and that one over there,</em> - you can figure out which ones depend on one another.
And once you have done then the idea is to try to make the hardware try to perform as many operations that it can concurrently, while not breaking any of the dependencies.
<b>Use the hardware better = performance gains.</b></p>

<h2>Memory and garbage collection</h2>

<p>If you say: <em>Get me this memory</em> and your computer gives it to you, you also have the responsibility to <em>de-allocate it</em>.</p>

<h5>Remember:</h5>

<p><b>With great memory allocation comes great memory de-allocation.</b> Surprisingly, <strong>a lot of people forget to do the second part</strong>; those people fall in the group of <em>B-programmers</em> or <em>Bad-programmers</em> - a curious lot. Its probably fine to be sloppy about memory issues if your program only runs for <em>a fifth of a second</em>.  But what if you are running a web-server that you want to run for months without crashing - then memory leaks <em>really are a bad thing</em>. At some point, someone got the idea to take this responsibility away from <em>bad</em>-programmers; this was the dawn of <em>garbage collection</em> - then the computer is responsible for de-allocating dynamically allocated memory.</p>

<h2>Garbage collectors</h2>

<p>They do make life easier, but you pay the price of slowing things down. So: <em><strong>you can be sloppy, and not worry about it.</strong></em> Don't be sloppy though - then you will need to collect less of it!</p>

<p>The bottom line here is:</p>

<p><b>There is no perfect garbage collector, but some are more equal than others.</b></p>

<p>In Julia you can disable the garbage collector when you want. To turn it on: <code>gc()</code></p>

<p>You can even specify your own memory manager.</p>

<h2>Electric fence</h2>

<p>Checkout using <code>efence</code> within <code>gcc</code> to check for memory leaks.
Static variables exist once it is allocated until the program ends.</p>

<h2>Smart pointers</h2>

<p>Pointers that contain information of how many other pointers are currently pointing to that place in memory.</p>

<h4>Bad side:</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Overhead of changing the increment/decrement information</p></li>
<li><p>Can be hard to deal with those if you have a circular linked list. <em>Solution:</em> even smarter pointers??  --> more overhead.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Constant pointers</h2>

<p>In C, C++, Fortran you can define constant pointers.
Its a way to tell the compiler that this specific variable will not change over the course of the program. The reason Fortran used to be much faster than C was due to <code>aliasing</code>.</p>

<h2>Static vs Dynamic memory allocation</h2>

<h5>Static</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>Then you know up front the size of the memory you want to allocate.</p></li>
<li><p>If you only use this, you are probably very unlikely to run into memory leaks.</p></li>
<li><p>The memory can be allocated to the stack if it is small enough, but a reasonable compiler would allocate it on the heap if it is relatively big. Only small enough statically allocated variables are allocated on the stack, but can the stack dynamically grow?</p></li>
<li><p>Garbage collectors do not work on the stack.</p></li>
</ul>


<h4>Dynamic</h4>

<p>Then you don't know up front the size of the memory you want to allocate.</p>

<p><em>Now we are getting to the most interesting part of the curse.</em></p>

<h2>Q: How are matrices stored in memory?</h2>

<p>It really helps knowing to know how matrices are stored in memory.
Are they <strong>colum-major</strong>, or <strong>row-major</strong>? <em>Julia</em> is like <em>Fortran</em>, storing matrices as <em>column-major</em> data structures; while <em>C</em> uses <em>row-major</em> data structures.</p>

<p>So then in your implementation of the simulation of <em>Life, the Universe, and Everything</em>, then might need to have <strong>big matrices</strong>; and you might save a lot of Big-Thought's computing time by knowing if it is faster to traverse your Big-Matrix by the columns-first, or by rows-first.</p>

<h2>Q: What about sparse matrices?</h2>

<p>If you have a lot of 0 entries in your matrix, then instead of allocating a big rectangular block of memory for it, then rather store it as a list of non-zero entries instead.
For example, if you had a diagonal-matrix you really would only need one vector to store the data, right? And similarily, a tri-diagonal one would need 3.</p>

<h2>The power of <em>views</em></h2>

<p>A powerful example: <em>What's a clever algorithm to transpose a matrix?</em> <strong>Just flip the indices!</strong></p>

<h2>Cache associativity</h2>

<p>When you have data in the big memory and you want it in the cache - what do you do? Where can it be?
The main philosophy here is: <em>How do we reuse data that is already in the cache?</em></p>

<h5>Non-associative cache?</h5>

<p>It might go something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Byte-1 of main memory can only go to Byte-1 in the cache</p></li>
<li><p>Byte-2 of main memory can only go to Byte-2 in the cache</p></li>
</ul>


<p>...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Byte-1024 of main memory can only go to Byte-1024 in the cache</p></li>
<li><p>Byte-1025 of main memory can only go to Byte-1 in the cache</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Reading a cache like this is <em>very fast</em>, as you don't have to search for the data too long - every byte has a fixed and known location.
But the main downside is: <em>you rarely use the whole cache!</em></p>

<p>Solution to this is called <em>padding</em>.</p>

<p><code>Bottom lines:</code></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Try to find the thing that takes the longest - <strong>and do something about it!</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Every bit of code that you write, <em>write it as you were trying to convince somebody else to use it</em>. Make it public (push on Github), and sure enough the person that is going to be reusing your code is,<em> well, most likely yourself!</em> Your group is also likely to benefit; and maybe somebody else in the world - <em>and there is that off chance that he/she might benefit you someday!</em></p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Profiling</h2>

<p>A profiler is a program to see where a program is spending most of its time (examples: <code>prof</code>, and <code>gprof</code>). Early profiling tools were mostly based on counting; monitoring how often, and how long calling a function takes.</p>

<h5>Downsides</h5>

<p>You are adding more instructions to your program! In a way you are interrupting the whole enterprise every time you call a function. If you are limited by caches, and writing in registers running a profiler on it makes the program run slower - so in fact you are timing a slower version of your program with the additional overhead the profiler inserts.</p>

<h5>Perks</h5>

<p>You get information about where the program is spending most of its time - then you can see what places you might want to speed up! Some hardware actually offer <strong>hardware profiling</strong> where the hardware has special registers only used for profiling - not interfering with the main program too much (however, you are still disrupting things - you need to unwind the pipeline, creating additional overhead, etc.)</p>

<h5>Timed profiler</h5>

<p>You can <strong>interfere less</strong>: instead of checking every line with a statistical profiler - you can check the program at a fixed interval, asking the program: <em>"Where are you now?"</em> in a fixed time interval.
Note: you can have <em>resonance</em> in for-loops - which gives a bad representation of how the program is actually running.</p>

<p>This is how the <code>Julia</code> profiler works.</p>

<p>If you are trying to figure out something about <em>branching</em>, then statistical profiling is better.</p>

<h2>Overloaded functions, profiling and <em>name mangling</em></h2>

<p>C++ supports overloaded functions i.e. functions that have the same names.
Then if you are profiling C++ code the profiler puts extra identifiers to distinguish the different versions of the overloaded functions. The identifiers have sometimes something to do with the variables that the functions use, or sometimes <em>just complete random gibberish</em> - this is called: <strong>name mangling</strong>.</p>

<h2>Astronomers and code writing</h2>

<p>Most of what astronomers do isn't so complicated that we really need to talk to a computer scientist about our code.</p>

<p>However, if you are gonna ask <code>NSF</code> about of a lot of computer resources - then it really helps to have collaborated a bit with a computer scientist, or at least <em>had conversations over lunch with a computer scientist.</em> And if you <em>really, really care</em> then you would write the proposal with one.</p>

<p>Still, computer scientists are expensive (compare 1 month of a computer scientist's time vs funding 2 grad students for a semester).
And yet, sometimes you are required to write the proposal with one.</p>

<p>In an ideal world these things would be well matched; <em>but sometimes a bit of bending is needed</em>.</p>

<p>The world of writing code between CS students, and astronomy students are different.
In astronomy we don't really care if you solve a problem cleverly, just that you solve it.
The typical scenario is that an <em>astronomy graduate student is thrown into a pond to solve a problem, hopefully to reach shore with the solution in hand</em>.</p>

<p>Taking people into lunch (for example a computer scientist - or maybe that particular girl you like) can be very productive.
If you converse with the former then you can potentially get hints on how to solve a particular problem efficiently, and you can expand upon it by googling about it; a very high-yielding collaboration per unit time, per unit dollar.</p>

<p>For the latter party you might ask: "Are there proposals that we want to work together on?"</p>

<p>In any case, <em>don't spend too much of your time to reinvent the wheel, when somebody else has already done it for you.</em></p>

<h2>Some things that we should do more of</h2>

<h5>Code reviews</h5>

<p>Make somebody else review your code. It doesn't need to be too formal - the bottom line is: <em>getting feedback can be beneficial!</em></p>

<p>It can be good for spotting coding standards, and other small bugs - but doesn't necessarily catch the <em>Big-Picture</em> things.</p>

<h2>Q: How do you organize your code into files and folders?</h2>

<p>Not a single magic answer.</p>

<h5>Using a bottom-up approach</h5>

<p>What usually works: Do a bottom up approach (<em>i.e. the start-without-a-plan plan</em>), starting with 1 file, and then expand it to a few files, grouping similar ones together, and then from there branching into dividing the code into subdirectories, again grouping similar-purpose code together.</p>

<p>There are tools that can be used to automate complex work flow issues - like <em>make-files</em>.
This can lead to a multi-step process: even before you type make - then you might need to <em>configure</em> the code, and then you have to <em>make</em> it, and then to <em>make install it</em> etc.</p>

<h5>Using Cmake</h5>

<p>If you have a complex thing that is not related to operating system issues, then <em>cmake</em> might be useful.
It makes a lot easier to have logic in your build system - you can have if and loops, and variables - to do <em>logic!</em>.</p>

<h2>Q: How should we use Git tags?</h2>

<p>If you cloned an ever changing code to use for a project, and then when you update it something doesn't work as it did, then in principle you can revert to an earlier point in time.
However, it might not be obvious to what point in time to revert to!
Then, <code>tags</code> can come in handy: you can tag your version that you used, making it much easier to find that specific version later.</p>

<p><b>Tag-example:</b> <em>Final-version-that-was-used-for-my-paper</em></p>

<h2>Q: What is the difference between <em>libraries</em> and <em>packages</em>?</h2>

<p>In the old days people compiled code into libraries and then linked other code to those libraries.
Programming languages like Python now offer you to manage your code in packages - which is much more convenient (you don't have to spend time with linking issues - usually you are just an <code>addPackage()</code> away from using somebody else's packaged code!) This has saved many a person a lot of time.</p>

<h2>Basic optimization techniques for serial code</h2>

<h5>Ideas for simple optimizations</h5>

<ul>
<li><p>Don't call your functions too often</p></li>
<li><p>Pass pointers rather than by reference</p></li>
<li><p>Know what your computer is doing - what is going on under the hood?</p></li>
<li><p>Providing types at compile-time</p></li>
<li><p>If using an interpreted language: <em>Vectorize!</em></p></li>
<li><p>Reduce branching</p></li>
</ul>


<h5>Loops</h5>

<p>Compilers can be smart, and can speed up one-dimensional loops.
They have a harder time to figure out of how to make nested loops faster.</p>

<h2>Difference between unit tests and regression tests</h2>

<h5>Unit tests</h5>

<p>A test that makes sure that one function in your code (or one small, and very well defined part of your code) works properly.</p>

<h5>Regression tests</h5>

<p>Bigger scale tests, that usually combine many functions, and to check if they are working correctly together. For example:
Calculating the Planck spectrum and then write the results to an external ASCII file.</p>

<h2>Using _Try-Catch</h2>

<p>Its a way to see if the program says: <em>"Hey! There is a problem here!"</em> - then if you don't have a <code>Try-Catch</code> clause your program will crash.
An <code><em>IF</em></code> statement can also work if you know how it can fail.
However, the advantage of Try-Catch is that you can catch some errors that are buried deep down maybe.
Still, its a much more expensive way to deal with a problem, rather than using an <code>IF</code> statement.
Its for things that don't have a clear order. It doesn't really happen too often in scientific programming.
Good places to use would be in <em>I/O</em>, and <em>networks</em>.</p>

<h2>Q. Should we optimize serial code first, before we parallelize it?</h2>

<p>It kind of depends on your problem. They key is to think about: "How are you gonna parallelize it?"
It can be <code>embarrassingly parallel</code> , and you can then basically distribute the serial code to a lot of workers and gain speedups that way. If not, then you can also go into the idea of parallelizing at multiple levels.</p>

<p><code>Bottom lines:</code></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Profile your code!</strong></li>
<li>If you are going to be running a code a lot - <strong>benchmark it.</strong></li>
</ul>


<h2>Worrying about hardware?</h2>

<p>Not so much. The thing is: in a few years you will be running your code on a different chip on a different system, maybe somewhere on the cjoud. So at this point, don't worry too much about the low level hardware side of the coding. Moreover, ignore <em>RISCs</em> and <em>CISCs</em> - except if you are planning on buying a supercomputer!</p>

<h2>When should we use vector processors?</h2>

<p>The most common vector processors today are graphics chips.
If you are doing the same operations on the same data again, and again, and again, then you might be better off using a graphics card, letting it perform these operations. It is not uncommon to get around 2x performance or more that way, with little effort.</p>

<p>Make your compiler optimize for your computer?
Can get around 10x performance.</p>

<h2>Jobs on a supercomputer</h2>

<p><strong>If the supercomputer is homogeneous</strong>, i.e. has the same type of chips as computing nodes, then it might be very advisable to compile your code for that exact chip. It might just be worth your while to spend those 5 minutes reading that <code>man</code> page to check what flags you need to use in order to optimize the code, to get that performance increase you are looking for!</p>

<p><strong>If your supercomputer is heterogeneous</strong>, i.e. has different types of chips as computing nodes, some AMD over here, and some Intel chips over there. Then you have to two choices:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><em>You compiled it and optimized it for one particular chip.</em> Then it won't run on the other types (it will probably crash!). The code might run faster, but you might just be spending your time waiting in the queue line!</p></li>
<li><p><em>You compiled it more generally, not optimizing for a particular chip.</em> Then the code will probably run slower, but you'll be quicker out of the queue line!</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Real world testing vs micro-benchmarking</h2>

<p><em>Where you are blazingly fast at multiplying a bunch of numbers, but Microsoft Word performs differently.</em></p>

<h2>More about caches</h2>

<p>In practice a computer has multiple cache levels.
Normally what you do is specify the L2 cache size, as the L1 is usually more constrained in size, and sometimes you see the effect of the computer moving data around in these different levels.</p>

<h4>Can cache sometimes be too big - so that it might actually slow you down?</h4>

<p>Yes, this applies to L1 caches. For a larger cache it is harder to have a fast clock speed; it takes longer to move electrons over a bigger distance, than a smaller distance.</p>

<h4>Is there an optimal ratio of processor clock speed, and cache size?</h4>

<p><strong><em>Yes, the fastest, and the biggest L2 cache size!</em></strong> Well, still its not exactly that simple. The chip manufacturers are kind of trying to figure this out for you - they want to make chips that people buy.</p>

<p><strong>Example (see graph in last class)</strong>:
If I were to go from 2mb to 8mb in L2 cache size, the range of which it took the same amount of time while still increasing the data size steadily, would probably be around 4 times as big (see graph in last class).</p>

<h2>Using SSD drives - does it mean performance increase vs. using magnetic disks?</h2>

<p><strong>It depends on what you want to do.</strong></p>

<p><b>For sequential reading, and sequential writing</b> the old magnetic disk actually perform quite well with respect to the SSD drives (the platter is reading of a very fast spinning disk), and the old fashioned ones are still a cheaper option if you are working with huge amount of data.</p>

<p><b>However, for random reading</b> the old fashioned disks are much slower, while SSD are much better - physically moving things like the platter needle in the old hard drives is much slower than moving electrons around in an SSD.</p>

<h2>Are there hybrid systems, that combine a normal processor, and a vector processor?</h2>

<p>Yes, there are; usually it is a CPU processor, bundled with a graphics co-processor.</p>

<h2>Two different parallelisms</h2>

<h4>Structure-level-parallelism</h4>

<p>When you can have your code such that is making use of <strong>structure-level-parallelism</strong>; you can get the benefit of the hardware doing different instructions at the same time - meaning performance increase via pipelining.</p>

<h4>Data-level-parallelism</h4>

<p>Write your code so that is easy for the compiler to find ways to do <strong>data-level-parallelism.</strong>
Modern compilers, have instruction level cache, and are constantly trying to figure out how they can use its computation units effectively. They break the instructions into smaller chunks, and try to order them in a smart way.</p>

<p>Write the working set data small enough so that it can fit into the cache - this way you can potentially get an increase the performance several times.</p>

<h2>When optimizing - optimize the slowest part!</h2>

<p>Still you have to be aware that the total execution time will still depend on all the parts of the program. <em>For example:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p>You have a program that is 10 parts, each of which takes 10% of the time to run. You choose one part to optimize, making it effectively free to perform. - <em>This way, you only make the program 10% faster.</em></p></li>
<li><p>You have a program that is 10 parts, where one of the part takes 90% of the time to run. You choose this part to optimize, making it effectively free to perform. - <em>This way, you make the program 10x faster!</em></p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Branch predictions</h2>

<p>Pretty cool way to make your compiler to work for you - <code>Need to look better into this!</code>
You can speed things up by reducing the instructions performed on your branch.
Still sometimes the only thing to do is: <em>compile, and compile, and hope!</em></p>

<p>Sometimes things that you think should take longer don't: look at the first part from 0.5 to around 2 - the curve is almost flat. There we are probably making good use of the <i>caches</i>.
Then as we keep using bigger and bigger arrays, we see a linear increase in time: we are starting to use the main memory.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> <i>Some people saw strange bumps/spikes in their curves; probably due to memory-cache interactions, where the computer is trying to be smart, but pays a price in performance for it</i>.</p>

<h2>What are caches though?</h2>

<p>Caches, are a small amount of memory that is better accessible to the CPU; the memory access is much, much faster, than accessing the main memory.
Accessing the memory is slow, and expensive.
Smaller caches are relatively fast, while bigger ones are slower.</p>

<h1>Discussion on chapter 6: Computer Organization</h1>

<h2>When do we need queues, and when do we need stacks?</h2>

<p>If you wanna get a Starbucks - you stand in line and get your coffee the last.
However, if you are the last one to check in your flight-luggage, then there is a good chance that you are the first to get it back (bags are usually stacked on top of each other).</p>

<p><strong>Queues:</strong> - Well if you need to do things that require you to do them in a particular fixed order.</p>

<p><strong>Stacks:</strong> - Function calls for small variables. They are not efficient when you have dynamic memory allocation. Moreover, you have to be careful with using stacks and recursive functions - can lead to <code>stack overflows!</code></p>

<p><i>
Check out <code>tail recursion</code> though: The ability to implement neat recursive algorithms without doing terrible things.
</i></p>

<h2>Registers, stacks, and heaps</h2>

<p><strong>Registers</strong><br/>
Registers are a <i>property of the hardware</i>, while the stacks, and heaps are <i>software constructs</i>.
And accessing the registers is basically free - this is what you would like to do in an ideal world.</p>

<p><strong><em>stack</em> vs <em>heap</em></strong> <br/>
If its dynamically allocated, it is almost certain that the compiler will put it into the <code>heap</code> - its safer, and a reasonable thing to do. Still however, it costs time and performance.</p>

<p>A function can return data types that are small, on the stack, or return a pointer to a memory location on the heap (if the return data is big).</p>

<h2>Language choices</h2>

<p>Some languages were written a long time ago. Ideas like <code>"I would like to access the web"</code> were non-existent when the people were developing the initial versions of <code>Fortran</code>.
If you are doing text processing - then it makes sense to use Python or Perl - don't really try to do it in Fortran or C; you have to do some real acrobatics.</p>

<p>In general if you use a higher level language - then hopefully you need a fewer lines of code; and hopefully you have less bugs, and are quicker to get things done.
However using an interpreted language you have to live with the overhead it has to go through when interpreting.</p>

<p>One of the nice things about <code>Julia</code> - is that it combines some of the best of the ides of high-level language, as high performance, but its syntax is similar to Python's.</p>

<h2>Higher level language parallelism</h2>

<p><strong>Macro-use-framework</strong> Sometimes referred to as <em>embarrassingly parallel</em>  - still, this is often the best parallelization you can come up with. Why? A) its easy for you, and B) its easy for the computer to do.</p>

<h1>Astro 585 discussion 1</h1>
<p class="muted">29 January 2014</p>
<div class="postContent">
<p>I'm taking Eric's class: Astro 585, topics in Astronomy and Astrophysics; <em>High-Performance Scientific Computing for Astrophysics</em>.
Its a very discussion based class, and I thought I might try to post my notes here.</p>

<p><em>These notes are typed quite quickly during class - but I'll try my best to minimize wrong spelling!</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Anyways, lets see how it goes!</em></strong></p>

<h1>Discussion Wed Jan 29, 2014</h1>

<h3>Q: IDL precision, single or double?</h3>

<p>IDL's default is <code>single precision</code> - many oblivious grad students have suffered through history because of this.</p>

<p><em>I myself, a grad-student am started to be exposed to this! - Why are we still using a thing born in the 70s of which you can almost physically see the rust covering it? - Not even mentioning the digital handcuffs...</em> Stallman, are you picking your feet about this?</p>

<h3>Automating processes</h3>

<h4>Using scripts like <em>make</em></h4>

<p>Often if you find yourself doing stuff <em>again, and again (3 or 4 times)</em>. Then automating might be useful. Say you have a humongous table that lists lots of things about a new planet you found. For the next planet you find, you might want to have this table be automated.</p>

<p>You can automate things pretty easily in <em>Julia</em>.</p>

<h3>Reusing code</h3>

<h4>The difference between writing astronomical software and developing drugs for a pharmaceutical company</h4>

<p>The readings were pretty supportive of reusing code. However, you have to have two things in mind:</p>

<p><strong>Beware of Licenses</strong> - This can be troublesome, and can become very hindering for the expansion of projects. - Remember Eric's story about <em>Numerical Recipes</em> - sort of like: <code>All of your thoughts belong to us</code> type of deal.</p>

<p><strong>Libraries</strong> - Be sure to know that they are actually doing what you want them to do!</p>

<h3>Any tips about refactoring code, or start from scratch?</h3>

<p><strong>Difficult to answer, depends on the problem</strong>. Rather than rewrite everything maybe focus on rewrite a few functions. And do it in a ridiculously incremental level. Use <em>assertions, debuggers, warnings, print statements etc.</em></p>

<h3>Q: Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up type programming</h3>

<h4>Difference between academic programming and commercial programming</h4>

<p>In the old days, everybody had these massive plans (in the <em>Extreme Programming movement</em>) to make everything perfect from the beginning. Then it sort of transitioned to the <em>quick-and-dirty</em> movement (sometimes making programs that didn't even work!). Nowadays its a kind of pendulum between the two extremes.</p>

<p><strong>For an academic setting:</strong> Its very good to make small incremental changes. Still you have to have some overview. So maybe actually <em>programming from the middle might be the right thing to do</em>. Do keep in mind Donald Knuth's words: <code><em>"Premature optimization is the root of all evil"</em></code></p>

<p>Somebody suggested: <em>Bottom up, but keep it general.</em></p>

<h3>Q: Functional programming vs. Object oriented programming</h3>

<h4>Reusing objects as containers, or making functions do all the work.</h4>

<p>For example, you can have a galaxy-class and you can make it do photometry, redshifts, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Object oriented</strong> Languages like C++, and Java, make it easy to think in that way.
Once you start writing functions that have.
You don't need classes really, you can do things you want in C!</p>

<p><strong>Template meta programming</strong> <em>(still not exactly sure what this is - you can do it, but supposedly it is a little bit obnoxious)</em>.</p>

<p>Say you have a function, <em>an abstract integrator say</em>, and you are gonna pass it a variable.
But what if your function doesn't know what type you are gonna pass it?
Those types have different internal data structures.
If you had a pre-compiled language, the compiler wouldn't really know what type you are gonna pass it - and it might barf.
<em>Julias</em> approach is to compile everything at runtime, so it then knows the type, and does it right.
So it is a way of getting a compile-type function arguments.</p>

<h1>Northern Lights</h1>
<p class="muted">19 January 2014</p>
<div class="postContent">
<p><em>"The prospects are at 6! The prospects are at 6!! Have you seen what's happening outside? It's green! Everything! I'm heading out in 5. Are you with me?"</em></p>

<p>I'm quite impressed of those of my friends that decided spontaneously leave the things they were doing after receiving such an abrupt phonecall without any other notice, then quickly put on a jacket and an extra pair of socks, grab a snack and to join me to drive into the night in an attempt to capture the Aurora. Different ways were used: some tried <code>filming</code>; other took <code>handheld pictures</code>; others <code>pictures on a tripod</code>; and still others on a <code>dolly</code>; some wrote <code>short stories and poems</code>; <code>some stood and leaned their head gaping just a little bit too much, straining their neck</code>; others <code>lay down</code> on the ground on the cold winter snow, laying absolutely still to see <code>if they could hear</code> them; others tried <code>running around and dancing</code>, either dancing with their rhythm or plainly just to keep warm. Some of my friends were irritated, hung up and went right back to sleep.
I tended to call back the former.</p>

<p>In particular I remember the expressions of my friends who were seeing them for the first time.
Becoming active in the Erasmus community back home was a logical extension of my own exchange program, and I made many international friends, <em>all of which absolutely adored the place</em> - and probably even more than us Icelanders! - haha!).
They came to Iceland to study (<em>some I think were more inclined on the parties, and having a swell time; but that is another story</em>), also hoping to see the Northern Lights - at least once; <em>"Solamente una vez!"</em> - that would be enough for me, one of my friend said.
And all of them did! - those that took the time to look for them at least!</p>

<p>I sometimes think if capturing the expressions they showed when seeing them for their first time, along with the plethora of foreign words and slang they used to describe them as they saw them (I believe I still remember some of the Italian ones!), might have been a worthier material to capture than the lights themselves. The Aurora will come again, but those first time expressions only happen once.</p>

<p>The northern lights do not wait for anybody. Although various websites that try to predict their visibility they are not always that accurate as viewing conditions depend on many dynamic factors; cloud cover, seeing, time of day, and solar activity, capriciousnes of Icelandic weather, etc.</p>

<p>Still, as 2013 was at the peak of the sun-spot cycle, the trips added up, and over the course of last year I ended up accumulating quite a few timelapse scenes - some of which made use of a <em>homemade wooden Arduino+car-battery-dolly</em> - sometimes referred to as the <code>"Icebox"</code>, or <code>"Bomb Slider"</code>.
I decided to make a video-project out of it.

<h1>Plotting Planck's Law</h1>
<p class="muted">18 January 2014</p>
<div class="postContent">
<p>The <em>Planck function</em> or <em>Planck's law</em> describes the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature
\( T \).
Max Planck - the originator of quantum theory - proposed it in 1900, solving the Ultraviolet catastrophe. It remains a very important in physics (and particularly so in astrophysics) to this day.</p>

<p>Planck's law can be formulated in terms of frequency, \( \nu \) in the following way</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    B_\nu(T) = \frac{2 h \nu^{3} /c^{2}}{\exp\left( h\nu/kT \right)-1}
    \label{eq:planck}
\end{align}</p>

<p>and equivalently, in terms of wavelength \( \lambda \)</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    B_{\lambda}(T) =\frac{2 h c^{2} / \lambda^{5}}{\exp\left( hc/\lambda kT \right) -1}.
    \label{eq:bL}
\end{align}</p>

<p>In the figure below I plot the latter equation for two temperatures.
Here is the <code>Python</code> script, <a href='https://github.com/gummiks/gummiks.github.io/blob/master/scripts/astro/planck.py'>planck.py</a>, which I used to produce the plot.</p>

<h1>Fossá - (The River of Waterfalls)</h1>
<p class="muted">27 December 2013</p>
<div class="postContent">
<p><em>"Lets cut to the case we talked about: lets go somewhere!"</em>, I told my friends upon arriving back at the Iceberg.</p>

<p><em>"Alright, where then?"</em>, they answered back.</p>

<p>We kind of worked out a loose plan: To go to <a href="http://500px.com/search?q=sn%C3%A6fellsnes">Snæfellsnes</a> a peninsula in the West of Iceland sometimes known for containing a pathway to the center of the Earth (ask Jules Verne!).
We also knew that it offers quite a few scenic places.
Still, however, it is also renowned for its capricious weather this time of year (commonly called <em><em>algjört vindrassgat</em></em> in Icelandic; for English speakers: it has bad connotations with wind).
And sure enough we heard:</p>

<p><em>"Its gonna be windy out there, perhaps a storm - so watch out!".</em> Our plans changed. Instead of going North-West, East it was instead. The journey to the center of the Earth had to wait a better time.</p>

<p><strong><em>The plan:</em></strong> No plan really, lets just go to our friend's house in the countryside and take it from there, taking care to bring the following things with us:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cameras, tripods, lenses and other camera equipment</li>
<li>Clothes, lots of them - its gonna be cold!</li>
<li>Sleeping bags</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>A thermocup to keep our coffee warm - again, its gonna be cold!</li>

<p> <em>"What kind of car do you guys have?"</em> my friend's dad asked.</p>

<p><em>"A jeep!"</em>, we promptly answered.</p>

<p><em>"Good"</em>, he nodded while bringing a book of Icelandic roads loaded with pictures of iconic places near them.</p>

<p><em>"See those waterfalls here? Háifoss (Literally: Tall-Waterfall), and Granni (either; neighbour or something thin), where the former one is the second tallest waterfall in all Iceland.
Also, do notice that this picture is taken during summer.
I've never seen it during winter - it might be worth for you to take a look at and see how it looks like.
What do you think?</em>"</p>

<p>And indeed, we took it from there.
Resolving to start the journey before sunrise the following day to get some sunrise time-lapses.
This might sound more ambitious than it was - twilight was at around 10 am, and sunrise at 11:15 am - it really wasn't that hard.</p>

<p>Still, on our way there we managed to get our jeep stuck in the snow- the type of stuck that all crew members had to get out of the car and start showeling - at least 4 times.
Intelligent as we were, we only brought one showel, so the ones not showeling defaulted to using their hands and boots to help out.
When you got tired you had fun by photographing the others working their asses off.</p>

<p>In retrospect we did learn a few things after the trip: bring at least two shovels, and definitely more coffee - in the cold you drain it much faster than you thin!</p>
