<h1>The ride East to go West</h1>
<p class="muted">27 May 2014</p>
<div class="postContent">
<p>It was a bright day.
I noticed how unusually clear the sky was - a nice change from the winter clouds that bring all the snow.
I saw the bus with the <em>"travel your world with us"</em> logo, and was greeted by the bus driver.
I was the first one to arrive.</p>

<p>"How are you doing? Going to Baltimore through Harrisburg, are ya? Step right on in!"</p>

<p>He spoke with a surprisingly squeaky voice for his size, but spoke in a very slow and direct manner - you immediately got the impression that he had been in the public transport system for a long time; that he knew the ins and outs of the system; that he knew what he was talking about.
He wore spectacles, those round John-Lennon types.
If I had met him in another setting my first guess would have been that he worked in a hot air balloon exploring uncharted territories in the South-hemisphere; or a doctor in some of the Western movies, healing a wounded hero.</p>

<p>"We still got 10 minutes?" asked a guy with a rough tangled hair and beard, wearing a baja-hoodie over a green State Patty's day T-shirt; the quintessential college kid.
"Yes", the driver answered.
He quickly realized the kids intent and remarked, "You can go ahead and smoke your cigarette - and in fact, I'll join you!"</p>

<p>There they stood close to the bus, putting up their sunglasses first; and then smoking; the young and the old, in the cold.
Then off we went, with powerful flares of the horns of this mighty bus, and like that, we left the snowy streets of State College, for something entirely different.</p>

<p>The driver kept yawning on the way, I won't say as frequently as a gold fish opens its mouth, but the yawning had a steady periodicity to it.
A can of diet Mountain Dew quickly beat the frequency down.
He immediately seemed more intent on driving.</p>

<p>We drove past the Susquehanna river.
I remembered Kerouac describing it as one of the mournful rivers of the East Coast.
To me it felt cold and fierce, almost terrifying: frozen, not solid, but filled with cracked icebergs that stick out of it; thorns that carve out wider banks and steeper cliffs, and somewhere in the middle of all this stands a miniature Statue of Freedom, unshaken by the shards. Freedom persisted.</p>

<p>It is interesting to get to see and experience America through my own eyes, a country which has shaped Western culture in so many areas and aspects.
The proportions and scales of everything are so different from what I am used to.
The cars, the trucks, the pickups, the red plastic cups, the roads, the magnificently great houses, distances that can only be crossed by car, 'bridge-may-be-icy-signs', stores that have inventories of forklifts and golf-cars fit for a small nation, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>In all, it was quite an ordinary bus trip, with people with their noses and pupils fixed on the transistors in their hand, some had headphones, and some which sang to themselves that new song by Pharrell which is going like mad over all America and further (probably higher than they thought they were singing), and the young mother with the crying baby in the back, and the interested middle-aged woman with the tattoos who was happy to help her out with the baby.
In any case, it gave me some time to think, read the Pennsylvanian landscape (trees, trees), and put some ideas down on paper.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was at a student bar in Baltimore - not far from the Paper Moon; a hip place if you deem it from their zealous and colorfully decorated mannequins in their yard.
The place was packed for a Wednesday night; people living in the here and now. A lot of pictures were on the walls, sport pictures, baseball, football.
"I like Baltimore - its like living in an action movie; you can see police chases out your front window", said my friend over our big meal.
"... and I'm pretty sure this 24/7 Pizza place has bulletproof glass in the counter. Some neighbourhoods are good though - the trick is to know were they are, and not wander too far off!".
The meal kept me full for the entire night and the whole next morning, as I left this Capital of Crime for the West.</p>

<p>I knew it was an old airplane. The row of the TV screens reminded you of those kaleidoscopes you used to play around with as a kid; the color palette of the screens were off, each set in a different way: blue, green, yellow, purple, all with this crazy, acidic, fluorescent hue.
I was riding west in The psychedelic plane; Jefferson Airplane.
A particular song started to play in my head, and I wondered if I was stuck in a Big Lebowski scene, or maybe if you are in one of those funny bathrooms when you have two opposite mirrors facing each other, and you have billions, and billions of copies of yourself smiling at you; wishing only that you could see through the back of your head.
I dozed off, as we flew across the bulk of the American continent.</p>

<p>And this was really the way that my whole spring break experience began, and the things that were to come are too fantastic not to tell.</p>

<h1>The Parking Lot</h1>
<p class="muted">27 April 2014</p>
<div class="postContent">
<h3>The Parking Lot</h3>

<h4>- As in people who park, and the people who somehow supervise parking</h4>

<p>The 10 cents clinked as they ran through the thin black slit. One foot on the white parking stripe.</p>

<p>The meter blinked.</p>

<p>It read: 3 minutes.</p>

<p>"Hey you! Yes, you! Come over here! I see what you are trying to do, you are trying to cheat the system: you staying in the car, looking around, while your girlfriend over there goes out on her business, just to put coins in the meter when you see the parking officer coming - You know that parking here is expensive? Where are you from in Oregon?", said the man in the big Ford, in a strong, commanding voice.
"We are not from Oregon, we just rented the car there - the thing is ..", answered the young man in an uncertain voice, as he walked up to the shaded windows of the oversized Ford. The engine was on.
"Not from Oregon? I reckoned so from your licence plate. Wherefrom are you then?", the man in the car quickly intervened, cutting the former off mid sentence.
"Wherefrom? I'm from Iceland, and we're visiting Vancouver briefly; we drove from Oregon. We actually study in Pennsylvania in the States - I study astrophysics."
"Iceland! My god man, I've never met anybody from Iceland. Tell me, are there black people there, do you reckon' that I'd fit in?"</p>

<p>For a split second, the young man seemed quite taken aback, utterly perplexed; under no circumstances had these two met before.</p>

<p>The young man, choosing his word carefully started:</p>

<p>"Aaaam, I'm sure you would, of course man, yes! Why not? But the thing about the car is, we just came to Canada, and we haven't got any Canadian coins, just this one that, .."
"Do you see that person over there? - That my friend, is a parking meter officer!", noted the man, a smile breaking over his face as he pointed at a man wearing a bright yellow vest over a distinctive uniform.</p>

<p>The young man's expression changed.
Some part of him wanted to run off; still he was bolted to the same spot.
Were the three minutes up? Who was this guy?</p>

<p>"So astrophysics? Have you heard what Hawking has been doing lately, with his symmetry theories?", the man in the car began, seemingly wanting to delve into a lengthy discussion about the topic.
The young man answered vaguely, and kept nodding abstractly: all his presence was focused on the man in the bright yellow vest who was going through his checking routine; his routine no doubt included his car; he drew closer.
The young man made a stern comment; his face grave - what was going on?
"You are cheating the system. You see, I am in the Canadian Secret Service; I guard the Prime Minister from time to time - twice now actually. I'm on leave now, but I couldn't help but notice what you were doing. I sometimes help out the local enforcement in this way", the man in the car answered enthusiastically.</p>

<p>His car was bigger than average; the type you really wouldn't want to drive downtown in big city; a big car for only one man. Unergonomic.
He had a couple of coffee cups, one empty sitting in the cup holder, the other in his hand, half full.
You could tell it was getting cold.
Several notebooks and loose, scrawled papers were scattered over the front and back seats.</p>

<p>"Tell you what, here are 2 Canadian dollars - we don't want to get you busted, do we?" said the man in the car, another wide smile breaking over his face. He produced a shiny coin.
Without hesitation the young man accepted the shiny coin and hurried to the meter.
The parking officer drew closer.</p>

<p>-The coin slit through: a heavier cling than before, both feet on the parking stripe-</p>

<p>-The meter blinked-</p>

<p>-A sigh of relief-</p>

<p>The engine roared. The young man walked slowly back to the big Ford, dragging his feet.</p>

<p>"Hey, have you ever met anybody from Iceland?", the man in the car yelled at the man in the yellow vest.
The parking officer said no; he was Croatian.
"I've been to Croatia man!", started the young man: "I was there a few years ago; had a swell time in Zagreb and the surrounding area. The Plitvice lakes - that azure blue all over the place - I dug them man!"
They exchanged names, and shook hands. Undoubtedly, they both forgot them right away. Awkward silence.</p>

<p>Making conversation, the parking officer started:</p>

<p>"How did you guys feel about the tryouts for the World Cup? You had a pretty good team, but what is his name - Gudjohnsen? He's retiring right?"</p>

<p>"Yep, it was tragic - we could have been the smallest nation ever to participate. Regretfully it didn't work out."</p>

<p>"A real shame that was, I was rooting for you guys", the man in the car started, in that same loud commanding voice.</p>

<p>Then the girl came; a big questionmark all over her face.</p>

<p>"Your boyfriend here, has made a major error. He is going to jail," the man in the car started in that same ruthless voice.
For a second he almost burst out laughing, but managed to keep a straight face, promptly launching into his spiel about the secret service.
Even more perplexity: the girl and the officer both wondered why a secret service agent would even start to reveal his identity.
The young man, however, for the first time started to smile: the parking officer made an excuse to leave, he had other meters to check, a routine to adhere to.
He bid farewell.</p>

<p>The conversation with the man in the continued; like nothing had happened.</p>

<p>"How good is your memory? Who, can you tell me, was the ferryman that carries the souls of the deceased across Styx in Greek mythology?"</p>

<p>Eyebrows up; strange looks.</p>

<p>"In fact, I believe one of the furthest objects in our solar system bear this name as well"</p>

<p>"Charon?", the young man answered.</p>

<p>"Indeed", the man in the car answered.</p>

<p>He started to back up.</p>

<p>"Be sure to bring coins with you next time."</p>

<p>As he backed the car up along the white parking stripes, both eyes fixed at them - much like a spider retreating to the centerpoint of its web where it best feels the vibrations of its domain - he called through the car window: "Who knows, we might see each other again."</p>

<p>The young couple exchanged looks.
They had no intention of staying there any longer.
They walked back to the car, staying clear of the white parking stripes, and drove off into the day.</p>

<div class="postContent">
<p>Goals to try to achieve</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Zen with Git</code></li>
</ul>


<h3>The "I'm embarrassed about my code mentality"</h3>

<p><em>"My code isn't perfect, I'll be embarrassed if I put it out there for everybody to see. What if there are bugs in it?"</em>
- Making code public accelerates the finding of bugs. Its better to find them, rather than letting them fest.</p>

<h3>Philosophical debate</h3>

<p>Science should be reproducible: do we have an ethical responsibility to share our code?</p>

<p>Throwing out stuff out there with little documentation might end up giving you headaches later in life; you might end up getting a lot of emails from users that want to use the code, but they didn't understand it properly.
Solution: <code>documentation</code>, <code>examples</code>, <code>short tutorials</code> - people will appreciate it!</p>

<h2>Code sharing in grant proposals</h2>

<p>Reviewers rarely comment on: <em>"Oh, this person is going to make their code public"</em>, with a bad connotations.
Sharing code is actually getting much more hip these days - which is a good thing!</p>

<h3>If your goal is to be useful</h3>

<p>Make tutorial style examples. People are more likely to use the code if those are provided.</p>

<h2>Should we publish our source code with the paper?</h2>

<p>That would be lovely actually.
There are already some journals out there that make you submit source code with your paper.
It might make more sense to have a source code repository though (for example on <code>Github</code> or <code>Bitbucket</code>), and just link to it.
That way you can also make smaller updates without have to resubmit your whole code when you fix that one tiny bug; less headache for the world.</p>

<h3>Finding bugs when code reviewing</h3>

<p>If you make it your purpose it life to find bugs, you will find them.
But they might be stupid bugs; like <em>"this was actually a tab, not 4 spaces".</em>
Common, friend, at the end of the day, this is supposed to be useful!</p>

<h2>Questions to think about for writeup</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>What did you get out of the project?</p></li>
<li><p>What did you do?</p></li>
<li><p>What were your parallelization strategies?</p></li>
<li><p>How did things scale when you parallelized them?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you use a profiler?</p></li>
<li><p>How did the tests go? What did you test? Did they pass?</p></li>

<h1>Astro 585 discussion 1</h1>
<p class="muted">29 January 2014</p>
<div class="postContent">
<p>I'm taking Eric's class: Astro 585, topics in Astronomy and Astrophysics; <em>High-Performance Scientific Computing for Astrophysics</em>.
Its a very discussion based class, and I thought I might try to post my notes here.</p>

<p><em>These notes are typed quite quickly during class - but I'll try my best to minimize wrong spelling!</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Anyways, lets see how it goes!</em></strong></p>

<h1>Discussion Wed Jan 29, 2014</h1>

<h3>Q: IDL precision, single or double?</h3>

<p>IDL's default is <code>single precision</code> - many oblivious grad students have suffered through history because of this.</p>

<p><em>I myself, a gradstudent am started to be exposed to this! - Why are we still using a thing born in the 70s of which you can almost physically see the rust covering it? - Not even mentioning the digital handcuffs...</em> Stallman, are you picking your feet about this?</p>

<h3>Automating processes</h3>

<h4>Using scripts like <em>make</em></h4>

<p>Often if you find yourself doing stuff <em>again, and again (3 or 4 times)</em>. Then automating might be useful. Say you have a humongous table that lists lots of things about a new planet you found. For the next planet you find, you might want to have this table be automated.</p>

<p>You can automate things pretty easily in <em>Julia</em>.</p>

<h3>Reusing code</h3>

<h4>The difference between writing astronomical software and developing drugs for a pharmaceutical company</h4>

<p>The readings were pretty supportive of reusing code. However, you have to have two things in mind:</p>

<p><strong>Beware of Licenses</strong> - This can be troublesome, and can become very hindering for the expansion of projects. - Remember Eric's story about <em>Numerical Recipes</em> - sort of like: <code>All of your thoughts belong to us</code> type of deal.</p>

<p><strong>Libraries</strong> - Be sure to know that they are actually doing what you want them to do!</p>

<h3>Any tips about refactoring code, or start from scratch?</h3>

<p><strong>Difficult to answer, depends on the problem</strong>. Rather than rewrite everything maybe focus on rewrite a few functions. And do it in a ridiculously incremental level. Use <em>assertions, debuggers, warnings, print statements etc.</em></p>

<h3>Q: Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up type programming</h3>

<h4>Difference between academic programming and commercial programming</h4>

<p>In the old days, everybody had these massive plans (in the <em>Extreme Programming movement</em>) to make everything perfect from the beginning. Then it sort of transitioned to the <em>quick-and-dirty</em> movement (sometimes making programs that didn't even work!). Nowadays its a kind of pendulum between the two extremes.</p>

<p><strong>For an academic setting:</strong> Its very good to make small incremental changes. Still you have to have some overview. So maybe actually <em>programming from the middle might be the right thing to do</em>. Do keep in mind Donald Knuth's words: <code><em>"Premature optimization is the root of all evil"</em></code></p>

<p>Somebody suggested: <em>Bottom up, but keep it general.</em></p>

<h3>Q: Functional programming vs. Object oriented programming</h3>

<h4>Reusing objects as containers, or making functions do all the work.</h4>

<p>For example, you can have a galaxy-class and you can make it do photometry, redshifts, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Object oriented</strong> Languages like C++, and Java, make it easy to think in that way.
Once you start writing functions that have.
You don't need classes really, you can do things you want in C!</p>

<p><strong>Template meta programming</strong> <em>(still not exactly sure what this is - you can do it, but supposedly it is a little bit obnoxious)</em>.</p>

<p>Say you have a function, <em>an abstract integrator say</em>, and you are gonna pass it a variable.
But what if your function doesn't know what type you are gonna pass it?
Those types have different internal data structures.
If you had a pre-compiled language, the compiler wouldn't really know what type you are gonna pass it - and it might barf.
<em>Julias</em> approach is to compile everything at runtime, so it then knows the type, and does it right.
So it is a way of getting a compile-type function arguments.</p>

<p><em>"The prospects are at 6! The prospects are at 6!! Have you seen what's happening outside? It's green! Everything! I'm heading out in 5. Are you with me?"</em></p>

<p>I'm quite impressed of those of my friends that decided spontaneously leave the things they were doing after receiving such an abrupt phonecall without any other notice, then quickly put on a jacket and an extra pair of socks, grab a snack and to join me to drive into the night in an attempt to capture the Aurora. Different ways were used: some tried <code>filming</code>; other took <code>handheld pictures</code>; others <code>pictures on a tripod</code>; and still others on a <code>dolly</code>; some wrote <code>short stories and poems</code>; <code>some stood and leaned their head gaping just a little bit too much, straining their neck</code>; others <code>lay down</code> on the ground on the cold winter snow, laying absolutely still to see <code>if they could hear</code> them; others tried <code>running around and dancing</code>, either dancing with their rhythm or plainly just to keep warm. Some of my friends were irritated, hung up and went right back to sleep.
I tended to call back the former.</p>

<p>In particular I remember the expressions of my friends who were seeing them for the first time.
Becoming active in the Erasmus community back home was a logical extension of my own exchange program, and I made many international friends, <em>all of which absolutely adored the place</em> - and probably even more than us Icelanders! - haha!).
They came to Iceland to study (<em>some I think were more inclined on the parties, and having a swell time; but that is another story</em>), also hoping to see the Northern Lights - at least once; <em>"Solamente una vez!"</em> - that would be enough for me, one of my friend said.
And all of them did! - those that took the time to look for them at least!</p>

<p>I sometimes think if capturing the expressions they showed when seeing them for their first time, along with the plethora of foreign words and slang they used to describe them as they saw them (I believe I still remember some of the Italian ones!), might have been a worthier material to capture than the lights themselves. The Aurora will come again, but those first time expressions only happen once.</p>

<p>The northern lights do not wait for anybody. Although various websites that try to predict their visibility they are not always that accurate as viewing conditions depend on many dynamic factors; cloud cover, seeing, time of day, and solar activity, capriciousnes of Icelandic weather, etc.</p>

<p>Still, as 2013 was at the peak of the sun-spot cycle, the trips added up, and over the course of last year I ended up accumulating quite a few timelapse scenes - some of which made use of a <em>homemade wooden Arduino+car-battery-dolly</em> - sometimes referred to as the <code>"Icebox"</code>, or <code>"Bomb Slider"</code>.
I decided to make a video-project out of it.
Below you can see the result:</p>

<h1>Plotting Planck's Law</h1>
<p class="muted">18 January 2014</p>
<div class="postContent">
<p>The <em>Planck function</em> or <em>Planck's law</em> describes the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium at a given temperature
\( T \).
Max Planck - the originator of quantum theory - proposed it in 1900, solving the Ultraviolet catastrophe. It remains a very important in physics (and particularly so in astrophysics) to this day.</p>

<p>Planck's law can be formulated in terms of frequency, \( \nu \) in the following way</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    B_\nu(T) = \frac{2 h \nu^{3} /c^{2}}{\exp\left( h\nu/kT \right)-1}
    \label{eq:planck}
\end{align}</p>

<p>and equivalently, in terms of wavelength \( \lambda \)</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    B_{\lambda}(T) =\frac{2 h c^{2} / \lambda^{5}}{\exp\left( hc/\lambda kT \right) -1}.
    \label{eq:bL}
\end{align}</p>

<p>In the figure below I plot the latter equation for two temperatures.
Here is the <code>Python</code> script, <a href='https://github.com/gummiks/gummiks.github.io/blob/master/scripts/astro/planck.py'>planck.py</a>, which I used to produce the plot.</p>

<h1>Fossá - (The River of Waterfalls)</h1>
<p class="muted">27 December 2013</p>
<div class="postContent">
<p><em>"Lets cut to the case we talked about: lets go somewhere!"</em>, I told my friends upon arriving back at the Iceberg.</p>

<p><em>"Alright, where then?"</em>, they answered back.</p>

<p>We kind of worked out a loose plan: To go to <a href="http://500px.com/search?q=sn%C3%A6fellsnes">Snæfellsnes</a> a peninsula in the West of Iceland sometimes known for containing a pathway to the center of the Earth (ask Jules Verne!).
We also knew that it offers quite a few scenic places.
Still, however, it is also renowned for its capricious weather this time of year (commonly called <em><em>algjört vindrassgat</em></em> in Icelandic; for English speakers: it has bad connotations with wind).
And sure enough we heard:</p>

<p><em>"Its gonna be windy out there, perhaps a storm - so watch out!".</em> Our plans changed. Instead of going North-West, East it was instead. The journey to the center of the Earth had to wait a better time.</p>

<p><strong><em>The plan:</em></strong> No plan really, lets just go to our friend's house in the countryside and take it from there, taking care to bring the following things with us:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cameras, tripods, lenses and other camera equipment</li>
<li>Clothes, lots of them - its gonna be cold!</li>
<li>Sleeping bags</li>
<li>Food</li>
<li>A thermocup to keep our coffee warm - again, its gonna be cold!</li>
<li>A copy of the whole Hitchhiker's guide (<em>The Big Blue Bundle</em>-edition, containing all the books)</li>
<li>Towel (recommended by <em>The Guide</em>)</li>

<p> <em>"What kind of car do you guys have?"</em> my friend's dad asked.</p>

<p><em>"A jeep!"</em>, we promptly answered.</p>

<p><em>"Good"</em>, he nodded while bringing a book of Icelandic roads loaded with pictures of iconic places near them.</p>

<p><em>"See those waterfalls here? Háifoss (Literally: Tall-Waterfall), and Granni (either; neighbour or something thin), where the former one is the second tallest waterfall in all Iceland.
Also, do notice that this picture is taken during summer.
I've never seen it during winter - it might be worth for you to take a look at and see how it looks like.
What do you think?</em>"</p>

<p>And indeed, we took it from there.
Resolving to start the journey before sunrise the following day to get some sunrise time-lapses.
This might sound more ambitious than it was - twilight was at around 10 am, and sunrise at 11:15 am - it really wasn't that hard.</p>

<p>Still, on our way there we managed to get our jeep stuck in the snow- the type of stuck that all crew members had to get out of the car and start showeling - at least 4 times.
Intelligent as we were, we only brought one showel, so the ones not showeling defaulted to using their hands and boots to help out.
When you got tired you had fun by photographing the others working their asses off.</p>

<p>In retrospect we did learn a few things after the trip: bring at least two shovels, and definitely more coffee - in the cold you drain it much faster than you thin!</p>

<p><em>Eskimos had over two hundred different words for snow, without which their conversation would probably have got very monotonous. So they would distinguish between thin snow and thick snow, light snow and heavy snow, sludgy snow, brittle snow, snow that came in flurries, snow that came in drifts, snow that came in on the bottom of your neighbor’s boots all over your nice clean igloo floor, the snows of winter, the snows of spring, the snows you remember from your childhood that were so much better than any of your modern snow, fine snow, feathery snow, hill snow, valley snow, snow that falls in the morning, snow that falls at night, snow that falls all of a sudden just when you were going out fishing, and snow that despite all your efforts to train them, the huskies have pissed on.</em> </br>

<h1>A trip to the North; Canada</h1>

<p><em>"What are you doing for Thanksgiving break, and more importantly: where are you eating turkey?"</em> a friend asked me.
<em>"Who, me? I'm heading North, to Canada - I might not eat any Thanksgiving-turkey this year. Don't worry though, I'll just eat twice as much next year!"</em></p>

<p>We don't celebrate Thanksgiving in Iceland, so I didn't really mind missing out on the turkey (also: my family eats it during New Years Eve).
And yes, my Thanksgiving dinner ended up being a quick wrap-sandwich on the cold road, somewhere in the province of Quebéc.</p>

<p>We headed out, a crew of 4; three French, and one Icelander, travelling over 1800km in 5 days, covering 2 states, 2 provinces, in 2 countries.
We had a rough destination outline: A) Niagara Falls, from there swing up to B) Toronto to check out the CN-Tower; and then spend the remainder of the holidays in C) Montreal.
It was an ambitious goal.
It took some resiliance (mostly on the driver's part), some enthusiasm, and some power-music, but we did it.</p>

<p>As anticipated, the journey itself was a large part of the trip.
However, for me - the co-pilot and one of two master DJs - the time passed relatively quickly; for the driver I'm not as sure.
We did come prepared with a carefully crafted music playlist, consisting largely of songs made by indie and electronic groups that originate from an island a part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.
Judging by the fact that we all had certain songs playing in our mind for the rest of the trip, I might have played some of them once or twice too often.
Moreover, countless stories were told (some in French with English <i>subtitles</i>) about things that first came to our minds. Those stories will not be listed here - <em>they would fill volumes</em>.</p>

<p>As we were heading straight to the capital of Québec, the French-speaking state of Canada, I felt I had to shape up my (totally non-existent) French skills.
And sure I did: I learned some very crucial first words, providing me with a diverse and lucid vocabulary, forming a sturdy basis to further build on.
In return, I provided an equally descriptive vocabulary in my own mother tongue; words that ended up forming an effective and encrypted code language used in the midst of the French speaking Canadians - nobody speaks Icelandic, right?</p>

<p>I immediately felt that there was something about Canada that I resonated with.
Maybe it was the chilly weather, temperatures routinely dropping to -8C or -10C, and sometimes to -15C.
It was very interesting to see the Mediterranians' expressions seeing the temperature drop by one degree for every hour we drove North. The Icelander grinned.
Or maybe, maybe I was just glad to be finally travelling again.</p>

<p>Having only a rough outline of what to do, this trip - like all good trips are - was largely characterized by on-the-fly decisions and last minute finalizations.
Despite a few minor delays, everything went quite smoothly.
Living in a digital age where your smartphone has a better idea where you are going than yourself, and where you can find, read reviews, book, and pay for a hostel in less than 5 minutes,
it is getting exceedingly easy to travel.
So what are you waiting for dear reader, give yourself the time (and some money - but money is best <em>invested</em> in travelling), open your door and step out!</p>

<h1>Mt. Nittany</h1>
<p class="muted">21 November 2013</p>
<div class="postContent">
<p>Every time I walk up the stairs in Davey Lab, I get an exceptionally good view of a prominent geographic feature in Centre County, Pennsylvania, called Mount Nittany. One day, walking up those flight of stairs, from the 4th floor to the 5th, with a warm cup of coffee in my hand, I noticed that there was something different about the old hill. <i>She had changed colors;</i> the copious green blanket that she usually wears, she had swapped for a gleaming yellow and red coat! Postponing my duties, leaving them to cool off with my undrunk coffee; I stepped off into the outdoors.</p>

    The legend says that Nit-A-Nee (<i>the wind-breaker</i>) an Indian Princess, fell in love with a handsome Indian Brave of the tribe called Lion's Paw. This fearless Brave was killed in a fierce battle with the wicked Wind from the North. <br/>
<br/>
    When Princess Nit-A-Nee heard of Lion's Paw's death, she carried his body to the center of the Valley where she laid the fierless warrior in his grave, and built a mound of honor to commemorate his strength. 
    On the last night of the full moon, after she had finally raised the last of the soil and stone over his high mound, a terrible storm came unleashing itself with thunder and lightening and the wailing of a horrendous wind from the depths of the Earth. 
Every Indian in the Valley shuddered and all eyes were directed to Lion's Paw's high mound upon which the beautiful maiden Princess Nit-A-Nee was mounted with arms outstretched to touch the sources of the lightning bolts in the sky. <br/>
<br/>
Through the night they watched with awe as the Indian Brave’s burial mound grew and rose into a Mountain penetrating the center of the big valley between the two legs of the Tussey and Bald Eagle ridges. 
When the dawn finally came a huge mountain was found standing erect in the center of the Valley.<br/>
<br/>
A legend had been born. 
The mound and the maiden had given place to a Mountain, and standing on its summit was a Lion surrounded by eleven orphaned male cubs, each of whom had the courage of the fearless Indian Brave and the heart of the mysterious Indian Princess.
From that day forward every place in the valley was safe, and the Wind wrested nothing from the fields on which these Lions strode as fearless heroes from the Mountain - the Mountain which still stands as a breaker against the wicked Wind of the North.

<p><code>pamfýll</code></p>
<p>"Pamfýll" is an Icelandic/Danish word which nobody really knows the meaning of.
However, it is usually bundled with good luck. I guess I put it here thinking I might need it someday.</p>
