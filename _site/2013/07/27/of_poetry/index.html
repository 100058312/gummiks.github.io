		<h1>A Birthday with Borges</h1>

      <p><em>"Hey, let's surprise our friend on his birthday in a graveyard!"</em>.
At first, I was a bit sceptical about this idea, but upon execution it was quite surprising to our friend and the whole thing went <em>surprisingly</em> well.</p>

<p>However, this was not some random graveyard, which, if it was, could have acted as an ironic remainder of his (and our) eventual demise, but a very specific graveyard: the Cimetière des Rois or <em>Cemetery of Kings</em>), where J. L. Borges is buried - our friend's favorite poet.
We sat there by his tomb, a group of 11, and recited some of our favorite poems and short stories by him.
Having only read one piece by him beforehand, a short story called <em>Borges and I</em>, or <em>Borges y yo</em> in the original language, I didn't have much choice in choosing my contribution.
This piece, <em>Borges and I</em>, is a (really) short story he wrote about what he thinks of his image when he was an old and famous writer.
I recommend reading it, both the original Spanish version and an English translation can be found <a href="http://anagrammatically.com/2008/01/31/borges-and-i-borges-y-yo/">here</a>.
Supposedly though Borges himself was against translations, as things tend to get <em>lost in translation</em>.
We discussed about this <em>right up to the limits of logic</em> , as we came from varying cultures from four different continents, having only English as our common language.
We finally agreed that whenever we had the occasion we read both versions of a given piece (as most of Borges' pieces were in Spanish); the original one <em>for appreciation</em>, and its translation <em>for understanding.</em></p>

<p>One thing I immediately found curious, is that that on the rear side of his tombstone is written <em>"Hann tekr sverthit Gram ok leggr i methal theira bert"</em> - Old Nordic!
I was amazed!
Most of the words were very similar to their modern Icelandic counterparts, so I deciphered/translated it for my friends; <em>He takes the sword Gram and lays the naked blade between them</em> (a reference to Völsungasaga - The Saga of the Völsungs!)
My friend explained that Borges used a lot of references in his works,
often to the old Nordic sagas, which he highly appreciated.
He liked the "get-straight-to-the-point" approach of old Nordic storytelling, greatly contrasting the long-phrased poems and prose common in the Spanish language.</p>

<p>Never have I felt more like being in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097165/">Dead Poets Society</a>.</p>

<p>Well, until next time;
<code>¡Arriba, abojo, al centro, adentro!</code></p>

      </div>
      <div class="span4">
<h3>Me</h3>
<p><code>pamfýll</code></p>
<p>"Pamfýll" is an Icelandic/Danish word which nobody really knows the meaning of.
However, it is usually bundled with good luck. I guess I put it here thinking I might need need it someday.</p>
