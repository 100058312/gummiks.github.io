      <p><em>WOW</em>; for three reasons: First, I just left my home country for a looongish time, second, my airline was called WOW, and third their service was WOW-ishly slow - I almost missed my flight!</p>

<p>Well, thankfully I didn't miss it, and after eating a warmish baguette and smiling at the bad mistakes made by the two overly drunk guys sitting in the row diagonally in front of me (took a spontaneous decision to take a taxi all the way from Akranes to the airport, and bought the first ticket to Zurich - supposedly a random spot). Well, I eventually got there as well.</p>

<p>However, I was tired. Having only slept for two hours before my flight I didn't even bother to try to find my way to the train station myself, and I went straight to the information desk.
The girl in front of me had the exact same question I was going to ask; "How do I get to Geneva?" - it turned out she was Icelandic as well, moreover from Húsavík (like half of my family are from there); the world is smaller than I thought!
We resolved to share this part of the trip; trips are more fun with friends.</p>

      <h3>Trainride through Switzerland</h3>
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>


<p>The train ride was great.
I almost forgot how tired I was.
She had been all over Europe it seemed, knew most of its main languages, and was planning on going on a trip to more exotic places: Africa, Asia and perhaps Australia (if she had the money and time).
I wondered if I will ever travel so broadly, I haven't even been south of the equator...
Well, I hope so, and will then definitely add South-America to the list as well!</p>

<p>Switzerland seems like a cool place.
During the train ride - travelling practically across all of Switzerland - it was fun to see how the main language changed.
First German, but as we got more and more south, the German-speaking-Swiss-people gradually gave way to their French speaking cousins in the Lausanne and Geneva region.
Every place has its ups and downs though, and for now it seems that for Switzerland its their pricetags - they are too high!</p>

<p>I eventually found my way to CERN.
I felt like Gordon Freeman - I passed the gate at Entrance B, met the guard, got a quest to go to building 39 to grab my hazard suit (and key).
After smelling the ashes of nuclear waste when passing through the tunnels under the CLIC building, I found a crowbar near the Lambda reaction core in the sector F Lambda Complex; I was ready to save the world.</p>

<h3>Me</h3>
<p><code>pamfýll</code></p>
<p>"Pamfýll" is an Icelandic/Danish word which nobody really knows the meaning of.
However, it is usually bundled with good luck. I guess I put it here thinking I might need need it someday.</p>
