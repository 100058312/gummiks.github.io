<h1>A Birthday with Borges</h1>
<p class="muted">27 July 2013</p>
<div class="postContent">
<p><em>"Hey, let's surprise our friend on his birthday in a graveyard!"</em>.
At first, I was a bit sceptical about this idea, but upon execution it was quite surprising to our friend and the whole thing went <em>surprisingly</em> well.</p>

<p>However, this was not some random graveyard, which, if it was, could have acted as an ironic remainder of his (and our) eventual demise, but a very specific graveyard: the Cimetière des Rois or <em>Cemetery of Kings</em>), where J. L. Borges is buried - our friend's favorite poet.
We sat there by his tomb, a group of 11, and recited some of our favorite poems and short stories by him.
Having only read one piece by him beforehand, a short story called <em>Borges and I</em>, or <em>Borges y yo</em> in the original language, I didn't have much choice in choosing my contribution.
This piece, <em>Borges and I</em>, is a (really) short story he wrote about what he thinks of his image when he was an old and famous writer.
I recommend reading it, both the original Spanish version and an English translation can be found <a href="http://anagrammatically.com/2008/01/31/borges-and-i-borges-y-yo/">here</a>.
Supposedly though Borges himself was against translations, as things tend to get <em>lost in translation</em>.
We discussed about this <em>right up to the limits of logic</em> , as we came from varying cultures from four different continents, having only English as our common language.
We finally agreed that whenever we had the occasion we read both versions of a given piece (as most of Borges' pieces were in Spanish); the original one <em>for appreciation</em>, and its translation <em>for understanding.</em></p>

<p>One thing I immediately found curious, is that that on the rear side of his tombstone is written <em>"Hann tekr sverthit Gram ok leggr i methal theira bert"</em> - Old Nordic!
I was amazed!
Most of the words were very similar to their modern Icelandic counterparts, so I deciphered/translated it for my friends; <em>He takes the sword Gram and lays the naked blade between them</em> (a reference to Völsungasaga - The Saga of the Völsungs!)
My friend explained that Borges used a lot of references in his works,
often to the old Nordic sagas, which he highly appreciated.
He liked the "get-straight-to-the-point" approach of old Nordic storytelling, greatly contrasting the long-phrased poems and prose common in the Spanish language.</p>

<p>Never have I felt as much as being in the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097165/">Dead Poets Society</a>.</p>

<p>Well, until next time;

<h1>Arriving at CERN</h1>
<p class="muted">15 June 2013</p>
<div class="postContent">
<p><em>WOW</em>; for three reasons: First, I just left my home country for a looongish time, second, my airline was called WOW, and third their service was WOW-ishly slow - I almost missed my flight!</p>

<p>Well, thankfully I didn't miss it, and after eating a warmish baguette and smiling at the bad mistakes made by the two overly drunk guys sitting in the row diagonally in front of me (took a spontaneous decision to take a taxi all the way from Akranes to the airport, and bought the first ticket to Zurich - supposedly a random spot). Well, I eventually got there as well.</p>

<p>However, I was tired. Having only slept for two hours before my flight I didn't even bother to try to find my way to the train station myself, and I went straight to the information desk.
The girl in front of me had the exact same question I was going to ask; "How do I get to Geneva?" - it turned out she was Icelandic as well, moreover from Húsavík (like half of my family are from there); the world is smaller than I thought!
We resolved to share this part of the trip; trips are more fun with friends.</p>

      <h3>Trainride through Switzerland</h3>
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>


<p>The train ride was great.
I almost forgot how tired I was.
She had been all over Europe it seemed, knew most of its main languages, and was planning on going on a trip to more exotic places: Africa, Asia and perhaps Australia (if she had the money and time).
I wondered if I will ever travel so broadly, I haven't even been south of the equator...
Well, I hope so, and will then definitely add South-America to the list as well!</p>

<p>Switzerland seems like a cool place.
During the train ride - travelling practically across all of Switzerland - it was fun to see how the main language changed.
First German, but as we got more and more south, the German-speaking-Swiss-people gradually gave way to their French speaking cousins in the Lausanne and Geneva region.
Every place has its ups and downs though, and for now it seems that for Switzerland its their pricetags - they are too high!</p>

<p>I eventually found my way to CERN.
I felt like Gordon Freeman - I passed the gate at Entrance B, met the guard, got a quest to go to building 39 to grab my hazard suit (and key).
After smelling the ashes of nuclear waste when passing through the tunnels under the CLIC building, I found a crowbar near the Lambda reaction core in the sector F Lambda Complex; I was ready to save the world.</p>

<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p class="muted">14 June 2013</p>
<div class="postContent">
<p>Hi!</p>

<p>My name is Guðmundur Kári [read it however you like - Icelandic pronounciation can be quite hard, believe me!], and yes, I'm from Iceland, "the land of the ice and snow, with the midnight sun and where the hot springs blow...". I'm leaving this place pretty soon though, and that for quite a while it seems.</p>

<p>This seems to be my first post here, and I might as well tell you who the intended audience is; well, <strong>everybody</strong> - <strong>everybody interested enough</strong>.
My skills in predicting the future have never been that good, so I can not be sure what I will be posting here, but I can say that it will probably be largely governed by the typical things that interest a physics student (and btw I am one), like; <em>physics</em>, <em>coding</em>,<em>linux</em>, <em>guitar-and harmonica playing</em> and <em>more coding</em>.
Probably this site might also include some of my amateurish photography during my various (probably also amateurish) travels.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<p><code>pamfýll</code></p>
<p>"Pamfýll" is an Icelandic/Danish word which nobody really knows the meaning of.
However, it is usually bundled with good luck. I guess I put it here thinking I might need need it someday.</p>
