<h1>The Parking Lot</h1>
<p class="muted">27 April 2014</p>
<div class="postContent">
<h3>The Parking Lot</h3>

<h4>- As in people who park, and the people who somehow supervise parking</h4>

<p>The 10 cents clinked as they ran through the thin black slit. One foot on the white parking stripe.</p>

<p>The meter blinked.</p>

<p>It read: 3 minutes.</p>

<p>"Hey you! Yes, you! Come over here! I see what you are trying to do, you are trying to cheat the system: you staying in the car, looking around, while your girlfriend over there goes out on her business, just to put coins in the meter when you see the parking officer coming - You know that parking here is expensive? Where are you from in Oregon?", said the man in the big Ford, in a strong, commanding voice.
"We are not from Oregon, we just rented the car there - the thing is ..", answered the young man in an uncertain voice, as he walked up to the shaded windows of the oversized Ford. The engine was on.
"Not from Oregon? I reckoned so from your licence plate. Wherefrom are you then?", the man in the car quickly intervened, cutting the former off mid sentence.
"Wherefrom? I'm from Iceland, and we're visiting Vancouver briefly; we drove from Oregon. We actually study in Pennsylvania in the States - I study astrophysics."
"Iceland! My god man, I've never met anybody from Iceland. Tell me, are there black people there, do you reckon' that I'd fit in?"</p>

<p>For a split second, the young man seemed quite taken aback, utterly perplexed; under no circumstances had these two met before.</p>

<p>The young man, choosing his word carefully started:</p>

<p>"Aaaam, I'm sure you would, of course man, yes! Why not? But the thing about the car is, we just came to Canada, and we haven't got any Canadian coins, just this one that, .."
"Do you see that person over there? - That my friend, is a parking meter officer!", noted the man, a smile breaking over his face as he pointed at a man wearing a bright yellow vest over a distinctive uniform.</p>

<p>The young man's expression changed.
Some part of him wanted to run off; still he was bolted to the same spot.
Were the three minutes up? Who was this guy?</p>

<p>"So astrophysics? Have you heard what Hawking has been doing lately, with his symmetry theories?", the man in the car began, seemingly wanting to delve into a lengthy discussion about the topic.
The young man answered vaguely, and kept nodding abstractly: all his presence was focused on the man in the bright yellow vest who was going through his checking routine; his routine no doubt included his car; he drew closer.
The young man made a stern comment; his face grave - what was going on?
"You are cheating the system. You see, I am in the Canadian Secret Service; I guard the Prime Minister from time to time - twice now actually. I'm on leave now, but I couldn't help but notice what you were doing. I sometimes help out the local enforcement in this way", the man in the car answered enthusiastically.</p>

<p>His car was bigger than average; the type you really wouldn't want to drive downtown in big city; a big car for only one man. Unergonomic.
He had a couple of coffee cups, one empty sitting in the cup holder, the other in his hand, half full.
You could tell it was getting cold.
Several notebooks and loose, scrawled papers were scattered over the front and back seats.</p>

<p>"Tell you what, here are 2 Canadian dollars - we don't want to get you busted, do we?" said the man in the car, another wide smile breaking over his face. He produced a shiny coin.
Without hesitation the young man accepted the shiny coin and hurried to the meter.
The parking officer drew closer.</p>

<p>-The coin slit through: a heavier cling than before, both feet on the parking stripe-</p>

<p>-The meter blinked-</p>

<p>-A sigh of relief-</p>

<p>The engine roared. The young man walked slowly back to the big Ford, dragging his feet.</p>

<p>"Hey, have you ever met anybody from Iceland?", the man in the car yelled at the man in the yellow vest.
The parking officer said no; he was Croatian.
"I've been to Croatia man!", started the young man: "I was there a few years ago; had a swell time in Zagreb and the surrounding area. The Plitvice lakes - that azure blue all over the place - I dug them man!"
They exchanged names, and shook hands. Undoubtedly, they both forgot them right away. Awkward silence.</p>

<p>Making conversation, the parking officer started:</p>

<p>"How did you guys feel about the tryouts for the World Cup? You had a pretty good team, but what is his name - Gudjohnsen? He's retiring right?"</p>

<p>"Yep, it was tragic - we could have been the smallest nation ever to participate. Regretfully it didn't work out."</p>

<p>"A real shame that was, I was rooting for you guys", the man in the car started, in that same loud commanding voice.</p>

<p>Then the girl came; a big questionmark all over her face.</p>

<p>"Your boyfriend here, has made a major error. He is going to jail," the man in the car started in that same ruthless voice.
For a second he almost burst out laughing, but managed to keep a straight face, promptly launching into his spiel about the secret service.
Even more perplexity: the girl and the officer both wondered why a secret service agent would even start to reveal his identity.
The young man, however, for the first time started to smile: the parking officer made an excuse to leave, he had other meters to check, a routine to adhere to.
He bid farewell.</p>

<p>The conversation with the man in the continued; like nothing had happened.</p>

<p>"How good is your memory? Who, can you tell me, was the ferryman that carries the souls of the deceased across Styx in Greek mythology?"</p>

<p>Eyebrows up; strange looks.</p>

<p>"In fact, I believe one of the furthest objects in our solar system bear this name as well"</p>

<p>"Charon?", the young man answered.</p>

<p>"Indeed", the man in the car answered.</p>

<p>He started to back up.</p>

<p>"Be sure to bring coins with you next time."</p>

<p>As he backed the car up along the white parking stripes, both eyes fixed at them - much like a spider retreating to the centerpoint of its web where it best feels the vibrations of its domain - he called through the car window: "Who knows, we might see each other again."</p>

<p>The young couple exchanged looks.
They had no intention of staying there any longer.
They walked back to the car, staying clear of the white parking stripes, and drove off into the day.</p>

<h1>Characterizing the Teaching Spectrum</h1>
<p class="muted">23 April 2014</p>
<div class="postContent">
<h1>Speaker: Tim Slater</h1>

<p>What goes on in a kids brain when studying astronomy?</p>

<p>We are interested in this - because in this group are the future teachers of the field; the teachers of our children.</p>

<p>The spectrum of teaching strategies.</p>

<p>What is our galaxy called?</p>

<p>How many planets are there in our solar system?</p>

<p>It is not that the kids didn't retain any of the astronomy -</p>

<h2>What do professors want from their students?</h2>

<p>To know science, to know astronomy</p>

<p>To be able to talk science, and do it.</p>

<p>National academy agrees.</p>

<p>It is very important that you learn about traxoline. Traxoline is a new form of zionter. It is montilled in Ceristanna. The</p>

<p>The Montillation of Traxoline.
- Vocabulary
- You can answer the questions
- Students at Penn State are excellent at 'Playing School'</p>

<p>Just being loud doesn't help.</p>

<p>You don't learn Jackson EM by lecture, you had to sweat, there is blood still on some spaces.</p>

<h1>The flipped classroom</h1>

<p>Video lectures at home</p>

<p>Come to class to do homework</p>

<p>Lecture based is an old design:</p>

<p>The best learners, often make the worst teachers. They are, in a very real sense, perceptually challenged.</p>

<p>They cannot imagine what it must be like to struggle with learning.</p>

<p>The deficit of the expert</p>

<h1>Think-pair-share</h1>

<p>The teacher gets input on what students are thinking</p>

<p>Its not what the instructor does that matters; rather, it is what the students do that matters.</p>

<h2>Mini Debates</h2>

<h2>Office hours</h2>

<p>No scratches on the back-door</p>

<p>Work through questions in a tutorial based mode</p>

<p>Students are not tabula rasa</p>

<h1>Teaching Inquiry in Astronomy</h1>

<ol>
<li><p>Ask questions answerable through a scientific approach</p></li>
<li><p>Design strategies to pursue and collect data-based evidence</p></li>
<li><p>Communicate and defend conclusions based on collected evidence</p></li>
</ol>


<h1>Backwards faded scaffolding approach - stu</h1>

<h1>Impact of Professor's Disposition</h1>

<p>How do students see you? This matters</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Hoping everyone will get an A or serving as</p></li>
<li><p>A coach or a barrier</p></li>
<li><p>A pump or a filter</p></li>

<h1>Astro585 discussion</h1>
<p class="muted">16 April 2014</p>
<div class="postContent">
<p>Goals to try to achieve</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Zen with Git</code></li>
</ul>


<h3>The "I'm embarrassed about my code mentality"</h3>

<p><em>"My code isn't perfect, I'll be embarrassed if I put it out there for everybody to see. What if there are bugs in it?"</em>
- Making code public accelerates the finding of bugs. Its better to find them, rather than letting them fest.</p>

<h3>Philosophical debate</h3>

<p>Science should be reproducible: do we have an ethical responsibility to share our code?</p>

<p>Throwing out stuff out there with little documentation might end up giving you headaches later in life; you might end up getting a lot of emails from users that want to use the code, but they didn't understand it properly.
Solution: <code>documentation</code>, <code>examples</code>, <code>short tutorials</code> - people will appreciate it!</p>

<h2>Code sharing in grant proposals</h2>

<p>Reviewers rarely comment on: <em>"Oh, this person is going to make their code public"</em>, with a bad connotations.
Sharing code is actually getting much more hip these days - which is a good thing!</p>

<h3>If your goal is to be useful</h3>

<p>Make tutorial style examples. People are more likely to use the code if those are provided.</p>

<h2>Should we publish our source code with the paper?</h2>

<p>That would be lovely actually.
There are already some journals out there that make you submit source code with your paper.
It might make more sense to have a source code repository though (for example on <code>Github</code> or <code>Bitbucket</code>), and just link to it.
That way you can also make smaller updates without have to resubmit your whole code when you fix that one tiny bug; less headache for the world.</p>

<h3>Finding bugs when code reviewing</h3>

<p>If you make it your purpose it life to find bugs, you will find them.
But they might be stupid bugs; like <em>"this was actually a tab, not 4 spaces".</em>
Common, friend, at the end of the day, this is supposed to be useful!</p>

<h2>Questions to think about for writeup</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>What did you get out of the project?</p></li>
<li><p>What did you do?</p></li>
<li><p>What were your parallelization strategies?</p></li>
<li><p>How did things scale when you parallelized them?</p></li>
<li><p>Did you use a profiler?</p></li>
<li><p>How did the tests go? What did you test? Did they pass?</p></li>

<h1>Extreme Ice Survey</h1>
<p class="muted">15 April 2014</p>
<div class="postContent">
<p>It was 15th of April, an unusually wintery night for that time of year - it had been snowing.
The speaker: James Balog, a photographer, and publisher of 8 books, who founded the Extreme Ice Survey.
The topic: climate change, more specifically its effects on the avid glacial melting; a photographer's chase of ice.</p>

<p>What is a glacier? A block of ice, yes: a glacier is a place where it snows more than it thaws, so under normal conditions, a glacier builds up over the years, slowly, layer by layer.
Currently, we are in the opposite situation: the glaciers are melting; the glaciers are retreating. We see this effect all over the globe.
Go to Chacaltaya glacier in Bolivia in South America, and see that what used to be the highest altitude ski resort in the world; only to be greeted rocky slopes.
The World Bank has warned that many glaciers in the tropical portion of the Andes are expected to disappear within 20 years.
This will threaten the water supplies of nearly 80 million people as well as the future generation of hydropower. Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru depend on hydropower for about half their electricity.
See: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8046540.stm
Go to Sólheimajökull in Iceland.
See the new real estate land being made.</p>

<p>Ice is actually a fluid; like a thick malleable caramel - it changes with time.</p>

<p>Glaciers are not some kind of inanimate object; much to the contrary, they are alive.
They are responsive organisms, that respond quite heavily to their surroundings.
All of them are reacting; they are in retreat!
Something has happened in these last years of the <em>Anthropocene</em> - the era of human dominance on the globe.
We now have the power to change global atmosphere with our actions.
We are doing so at this very moment.
The natural rhythms of Nature are out of sync; Earth has a fever.
Global temperature is raising, hand in hand with the amount of carbon dioxide being emitted in the air, and the utter destruction of forests all around the globe.
This is not an abstraction, not mad ravings from Hippy scientists - these results are based on rock solid evidence.
Nature isn't natural anymore.</p>

<p>The collision between mankind, and the environment.</p>

<p>What are the two things we do as humans?</p>

<ul>
<li>We seek for patterns. This pattern has been found; the debate is settled.</li>
<li>We tell stories. How can we better tell this climate debate story? Photography. Photography is a great art form; a great tool to preserve memories.
It can preserve the unfathomable melting, in simple frames. Frames that tell the story, hour by hour, day by day, over a period of months; years.
How can we better tell this story?
How do you photograph climate change? How do you turn it into a frame?</li>
</ul>


<p>Illulusat glacier in Greenland.
Ice diamonds in Iceland.</p>

<p>We don't have a technological, nor an economical problem with climate change; we have a perception problem.</p>

<p>I don't believe in climate change, as belief has nothing to do with it.
<em>I strongly think</em> there is climate change, not because it is my choice; I draw my conclusion from the mountains of evidence out there.</p>

<p>We are poking an angry beast with sticks;</p>

<p>A strategy taken from the playbook of the tobacco industry</p>

<p>We sat there in Scwab Auditorium.</p>

<h1>Using Git</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><code>The path to enlightenment is through the struggle.</code></p></li>
<li><p>Make a lot of small commits - easier to backtrack.</p></li>

<h1>Build system</h1>

<h2><code>make</code></h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Be weary of <strong>tab</strong> and <strong>spaces</strong> - one of the most common mistakes is to think that those are the same.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes not meant to be static, but automatically generated. People sometimes make scripts that make the make file. Still, try to avoid this unless there is a very good reason.</p></li>
<li><p><code>cmake</code> is more sophisticated. <code>make</code> is a very old school but useful thing to use. <code>cmake</code> can work with variables, and do arithmatic - rather use <code>cmake</code> rather than a script that makes make-files.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Creating Packages</h2>

<h1>From Planetesimals to Giant Planets</h1>

<h2>Chronology</h2>

<p>In anchient times, like the 80s, we didn't really know that there were more planets out there.
Now we know of thousands.</p>

<h1>Questions from Planet Archaeology</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>How do planets form?</p></li>
<li><p>Where, when do planets form?</p></li>
<li><p>What determines planet masses?</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>How do planets form?</h2>

<h3>The story of Core Accretion</h3>

<ul>
<li>Once upon a time there were grains clumped together. With time they grew and grew, until they reached the planetesimal stage.</li>
</ul>


<p>At first: "Disk look like they are just transportation devices."
But in fact, they are very chemically active.</p>

<h4>Do they preserve molecules?</h4>

<p>Early on in the disk's lifetime, they emit a lot of UV radiation.</p>

<h4>How to detect planetesimals?</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Can't detect directly</p></li>
<li><p>No dynamical signature</p></li>
<li><p>What about chemical signatures?</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>Giant gas planets</h1>

<p>They carve a gap in the disk</p>

<p>Where do the moons come from?
- Just a smaller subversion of the planetary disk?</p>

<h1>Code reviews</h1>

<p>A global life skill:
- If you ask someone to do something for you; make it easy for them to do a good job.</p>

<p>If you ask a friend to review your code, and you have say 10000 lines of code, make sure to highlight the important part (maybe 8000 are stupid lines of code that don't really matter so much).</p>

<p>Some guidelines to have in mind for good coding:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use sensible variable, function,</p></li>
<li><p>Every function should have documention. The documentation should answer these questions:</p></li>
</ol>


<pre>
    PURPOSE:
    INPUTS:
    OUTPUTS: 
    NOTES: What assumptions does it make?
</pre>


<p></p>

<h2>Global vs Micro documentation</h2>

<p>When you have a bigger type project, then some kind of global documentation, whether it is a README, FAQ, how_to_get_started.txt, is a <code>a must</code>.</p>

<p>One major point: If you write a global be careful to keep it up to date!</p>

<p>The code itself is the authoritative representation of the documentation, so try to keep the documentation IN THE CODE - this way the global documentation won't get out of date. <em>An out of date global documentation can be worse than no documentation - it can actually lie to you!</em></p>

<p>Bottom lines:
- <code>Any 4 year old can use a make file.</code>
- <code>Make it easy for your users to get started with your code.</code></p>

<h1>Cloud Computing</h1>

<h2>Citing the cloud</h2>

<p>When should we cite the cloud - should I say that ".. and I used Google and Amazon cloud to do this".</p>

<p>Well, only if it is reasonable.</p>

<h2>Cloud optimizations</h2>

<p>If you are really optimizing tightly with respect to hardware then its a bit harder to to write really optimized code on the cloud as it is constantly being updated.</p>

<p>However if you are using normal super computer, you normally know better what you are running on (less frequent hardware updating).</p>

<h2>Running VMs on the cloud - does that induce a lot of overhead?</h2>

<p>What Amazon and Google are trying with the Cloud is to use their servers efficiently.</p>

<p>If you are a first year as me, then things in the computing world are almost certain to change between now, and when you are doing your thesis calculations.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>If you are trying to hack something and look cool - which would you choose: hack the Penn State <code>lionx</code> servers, or Google's servers?</p>

<p>Google are certainly more prone to internet hacks - but they also probably have specialized people working on these things.</p>

<p>When you are in a collaboration, you have to be aware of what your group as a whole thinks of security.
Should everybody be able to Read/Write? Be sure to set the correct permissions.</p>

<p>If you are an observer, and you have made a major discovery, where do you store your coordinates?</p>

<h2>Storage; disk access</h2>

<p>Every computer has a hard drive connected to it.
The fastest disk rate will be from that specific disk.</p>

<p>Supercomputers usually have a few file systems.</p>

<h4>Checkpointing</h4>

<p>If you have a job that runs for a month, then a good idea will be to check-point your code, i.e. to save partial data somehow. This way if your job gets killed then you won't loose one month of computing time, but just loose the time since you last saved it.</p>

<p>Writing efficient GPU much easier to understand; which would automatically take</p>

<p>Taking advantage of hardware things.</p>

<h2>Iterators</h2>

<p>If you can replace an array with an iterator, you can reduce memory accesses.</p>

<h2>Linked lists</h2>

<p>If you want to have a lot of insertions, and deletions, then a linked list is much better to use rather than an array.</p>

<h3>Me</h3>
<p><code>pamfýll</code></p>
<p>"Pamfýll" is an Icelandic/Danish word which nobody really knows the meaning of.
However, it is usually bundled with good luck. I guess I put it here thinking I might need it someday.</p>
