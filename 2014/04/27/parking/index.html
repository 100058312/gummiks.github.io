      <h3>The Parking Lot</h3>

<h4>- As in people who park, and the people who somehow supervise parking</h4>

<p>The 10 cents clinked as they ran through the thin black slit. One foot on the white parking stripe.</p>

<p>The meter blinked.</p>

<p>It read: 3 minutes.</p>

<p>"Hey you! Yes, you! Come over here! I see what you are trying to do, you are trying to cheat the system: you staying in the car, looking around, while your girlfriend over there goes out on her business, just to put coins in the meter when you see the parking officer coming - You know that parking here is expensive? Where are you from in Oregon?", said the man in the big Ford, in a strong, commanding voice.
"We are not from Oregon, we just rented the car there - the thing is ..", answered the young man in an uncertain voice, as he walked up to the shaded windows of the oversized Ford. The engine was on.
"Not from Oregon? I reckoned so from your licence plate. Wherefrom are you then?", the man in the car quickly intervened, cutting the former off mid sentence.
"Wherefrom? I'm from Iceland, and we're visiting Vancouver briefly; we drove from Oregon. We actually study in Pennsylvania in the States - I study astrophysics."
"Iceland! My god man, I've never met anybody from Iceland. Tell me, are there black people there, do you reckon' that I'd fit in?"</p>

<p>For a split second, the young man seemed quite taken aback, utterly perplexed; under no circumstances had these two met before.</p>

<p>The young man, choosing his word carefully started:</p>

<p>"Aaaam, I'm sure you would, of course man, yes! Why not? But the thing about the car is, we just came to Canada, and we haven't got any Canadian coins, just this one that, .."
"Do you see that person over there? - That my friend, is a parking meter officer!", noted the man, a smile breaking over his face as he pointed at a man wearing a bright yellow vest over a distinctive uniform.</p>

<p>The young man's expression changed.
Some part of him wanted to run off; still he was bolted to the same spot.
Were the three minutes up? Who was this guy?</p>

<p>"So astrophysics? Have you heard what Hawking has been doing lately, with his symmetry theories?", the man in the car began, seemingly wanting to delve into a lengthy discussion about the topic.
The young man answered vaguely, and kept nodding abstractly: all his presence was focused on the man in the bright yellow vest who was going through his checking routine; his routine no doubt included his car; he drew closer.
The young man made a stern comment; his face grave - what was going on?
"You are cheating the system. You see, I am in the Canadian Secret Service; I guard the Prime Minister from time to time - twice now actually. I'm on leave now, but I couldn't help but notice what you were doing. I sometimes help out the local enforcement in this way", the man in the car answered enthusiastically.</p>

<p>His car was bigger than average; the type you really wouldn't want to drive downtown in big city; a big car for only one man. Unergonomic.
He had a couple of coffee cups, one empty sitting in the cup holder, the other in his hand, half full.
You could tell it was getting cold.
Several notebooks and loose, scrawled papers were scattered over the front and back seats.</p>

<p>"Tell you what, here are 2 Canadian dollars - we don't want to get you busted, do we?" said the man in the car, another wide smile breaking over his face. He produced a shiny coin.
Without hesitation the young man accepted the shiny coin and hurried to the meter.
The parking officer drew closer.</p>

<p>-The coin slit through: a heavier cling than before, both feet on the parking stripe-</p>

<p>-The meter blinked-</p>

<p>-A sigh of relief-</p>

<p>The engine roared. The young man walked slowly back to the big Ford, dragging his feet.</p>

<p>"Hey, have you ever met anybody from Iceland?", the man in the car yelled at the man in the yellow vest.
The parking officer said no; he was Croatian.
"I've been to Croatia man!", started the young man: "I was there a few years ago; had a swell time in Zagreb and the surrounding area. The Plitvice lakes - that azure blue all over the place - I dug them man!"
They exchanged names, and shook hands. Undoubtedly, they both forgot them right away. Awkward silence.</p>

<p>Making conversation, the parking officer started:</p>

<p>"How did you guys feel about the tryouts for the World Cup? You had a pretty good team, but what is his name - Gudjohnsen? He's retiring right?"</p>

<p>"Yep, it was tragic - we could have been the smallest nation ever to participate. Regretfully it didn't work out."</p>

<p>"A real shame that was, I was rooting for you guys", the man in the car started, in that same loud commanding voice.</p>

<p>Then the girl came; a big questionmark all over her face.</p>

<p>"Your boyfriend here, has made a major error. He is going to jail," the man in the car started in that same ruthless voice.
For a second he almost burst out laughing, but managed to keep a straight face, promptly launching into his spiel about the secret service.
Even more perplexity: the girl and the officer both wondered why a secret service agent would even start to reveal his identity.
The young man, however, for the first time started to smile: the parking officer made an excuse to leave, he had other meters to check, a routine to adhere to.
He bid farewell.</p>

<p>The conversation with the man in the continued; like nothing had happened.</p>

<p>"How good is your memory? Who, can you tell me, was the ferryman that carries the souls of the deceased across Styx in Greek mythology?"</p>

<p>Eyebrows up; strange looks.</p>

<p>"In fact, I believe one of the furthest objects in our solar system bear this name as well"</p>

<p>"Charon?", the young man answered.</p>

<p>"Indeed", the man in the car answered.</p>

<p>He started to back up.</p>

<p>"Be sure to bring coins with you next time."</p>

<p>As he backed the car up along the white parking stripes, both eyes fixed at them - much like a spider retreating to the centerpoint of its web where it best feels the vibrations of its domain - he called through the car window: "Who knows, we might see each other again."</p>

<p>The young couple exchanged looks.
They had no intention of staying there any longer.
They walked back to the car, staying clear of the white parking stripes, and drove off into the day.</p>

<h3>Me</h3>
<p><code>pamfýll</code></p>
<p>"Pamfýll" is an Icelandic/Danish word which nobody really knows the meaning of.
However, it is usually bundled with good luck. I guess I put it here thinking I might need it someday.</p>
