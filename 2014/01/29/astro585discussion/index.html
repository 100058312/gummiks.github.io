		<h1>Astro 585 discussion 1</h1>

      <p>I'm taking Eric's class: Astro 585, topics in Astronomy and Astrophysics; <em>High-Performance Scientific Computing for Astrophysics</em>.
Its a very discussion based class, and I thought I might try to post my notes here.</p>

<p><em>These notes are typed quite quickly during class - but I'll try my best to minimize wrong spelling!</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Anyways, lets see how it goes!</em></strong></p>

<h1>Discussion Wed Jan 29, 2014</h1>

<h3>Q: IDL precision, single or double?</h3>

<p>IDL's default is <code>single precision</code> - many oblivious grad students have suffered through history because of this.</p>

<p><em>I myself, a gradstudent am started to be exposed to this! - Why are we still using a thing born in the 70s of which you can almost physically see the rust covering it? - Not even mentioning the digital handcuffs...</em> Stallman, are you picking your feet about this?</p>

<h3>Automating processes</h3>

<h4>Using scripts like <em>make</em></h4>

<p>Often if you find yourself doing stuff <em>again, and again (3 or 4 times)</em>. Then automating might be useful. Say you have a humongous table that lists lots of things about a new planet you found. For the next planet you find, you might want to have this table be automated.</p>

<p>You can automate things pretty easily in <em>Julia</em>.</p>

<h3>Reusing code</h3>

<h4>The difference between writing astronomical software and developing drugs for a pharmaceutical company</h4>

<p>The readings were pretty supportive of reusing code. However, you have to have two things in mind:</p>

<p><strong>Beware of Licenses</strong> - This can be troublesome, and can become very hindering for the expansion of projects. - Remember Eric's story about <em>Numerical Recipes</em> - sort of like: <code>All of your thoughts belong to us</code> type of deal.</p>

<p><strong>Libraries</strong> - Be sure to know that they are actually doing what you want them to do!</p>

<h3>Any tips about refactoring code, or start from scratch?</h3>

<p><strong>Difficult to answer, depends on the problem</strong>. Rather than rewrite everything maybe focus on rewrite a few functions. And do it in a ridiculously incremental level. Use <em>assertions, debuggers, warnings, print statements etc.</em></p>

<h3>Q: Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up type programming</h3>

<h4>Difference between academic programming and commercial programming</h4>

<p>In the old days, everybody had these massive plans (in the <em>Extreme Programming movement</em>) to make everything perfect from the beginning. Then it sort of transitioned to the <em>quick-and-dirty</em> movement (sometimes making programs that didn't even work!). Nowadays its a kind of pendulum between the two extremes.</p>

<p><strong>For an academic setting:</strong> Its very good to make small incremental changes. Still you have to have some overview. So maybe actually <em>programming from the middle might be the right thing to do</em>. Do keep in mind Donald Knuth's words: <code><em>"Premature optimization is the root of all evil"</em></code></p>

<p>Somebody suggested: <em>Bottom up, but keep it general.</em></p>

<h3>Q: Functional programming vs. Object oriented programming</h3>

<h4>Reusing objects as containers, or making functions do all the work.</h4>

<p>For example, you can have a galaxy-class and you can make it do photometry, redshifts, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Object oriented</strong> Languages like C++, and Java, make it easy to think in that way.
Once you start writing functions that have.
You don't need classes really, you can do things you want in C!</p>

<p><strong>Template meta programming</strong> <em>(still not exactly sure what this is - you can do it, but supposedly it is a little bit obnoxious)</em>.</p>

<p>Say you have a function, <em>an abstract integrator say</em>, and you are gonna pass it a variable.
But what if your function doesn't know what type you are gonna pass it?
Those types have different internal data structures.
If you had a pre-compiled language, the compiler wouldn't really know what type you are gonna pass it - and it might barf.
<em>Julias</em> approach is to compile everything at runtime, so it then knows the type, and does it right.
So it is a way of getting a compile-type function arguments.</p>

<h3>Me</h3>
<p><code>pamfýll</code></p>
<p>"Pamfýll" is an Icelandic/Danish word which nobody really knows the meaning of.
However, it is usually bundled with good luck. I guess I put it here thinking I might need it someday.</p>
